Exploratory research is employed, and a four-phase methodology is developed which combines a social network analysis with structural modeling. This is applied to the internal enterprise social network used by a British insurance company. The main results emphasize the most influential groups, their relationships, future knowledge flows, and the connection between the network's heterogeneity and structure, and employees' future knowledge sharing intention. These findings have both theoretical and practical implications. The theory is extended by proving that a social network analysis can be used as a tool for evaluating and predicting future knowledge flows. At the same time, a solution is offered to decision-makers so they will be able to: (i) identify the potential knowledge loss; (ii) determine leaders; (iii) establish who is going to act as a knowledge diffuser, by sharing what they know with their coworkers, and who is going to act as a knowledge repository, by focusing on acquiring increasingly more knowledge; (iv) identify the elements that influence employees' future knowledge sharing intention.

Integrated crisis-energy policy: Macro-evolutionary modelling of technology, finance and energy interactions	TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE			English	Article						Financial-etonomic crisis; Energy; Inequality; Macroevolutionary modelling	ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY TECHNOLOGIES; NETWORK EXTERNALITIES; ECONOMIC-GROWTH; CREDIT; COMPETITION; TRANSITIONS; CONSUMERS; INDUSTRY; DEMAND	Addressing four persistent problems, namely human-induced environmental change, financial instability, inequality and unemployment has now become an urgent necessity. To better grasp complex interactions between technological, financial and energy systems, we propose a formal behavioral-evolutionary macroeconomic model. It describes the coevolution of four populations, namely of heterogeneous consumers, producers, power plants and banks, interacting through interconnected networks. We examine how decisions by all these economic agents affect financial stability, the direction of technological change and energy use. The approach generates non-trivial, even surprising insights, such as that brand loyalty, captured by a network externality on the demand side, can increase the likelihood of bankruptcies of banks. Cascades of such bankruptcies are found to be more likely under greater income inequalities and higher electricity prices. We employ the model to assess macroeconomic impacts of sustainability policies along three dimensions: environmental effectiveness, financial stability and socio-economic consequences.

J	Mendi, P; Costamagna, R				Mendi, Pedro; Costamagna, Rodrigo			Managing innovation under competitive pressure from informal producers	TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE			English	Article						Innovation; Informality; Competitive pressure; Latin America; Africa	RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; FIRM-LEVEL; RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS; RESEARCH AGENDA; ECONOMY; PRODUCTIVITY; GROWTH; SECTOR; MARKET; ENTREPRENEURSHIP	The existence of a large informal sector may be a factor constraining formal firms' choices of innovation strategies in many developing countries. This paper addresses this issue and studies the impact on innovation of competition against firms in the informal sector. Using the World Bank's Enterprise Survey data from a sample of African and Latin American countries, we find that the marginal impact of informality on innovation by formal firms decreases with the intensity of competitive pressure from informal firms, consistent with an inverted-U relationship between propensity to innovate and competitive pressure from firms in the informal sector. This pattern arises even after controlling for the number of competitors, suggesting that the pressure that informal firms exert on formal firms go beyond a mere increase in the number of competitors.

Drawing upon threshold theory, we explore how lack of access to complementary skills at different points in the life course impacts founders' thresholds for exit. We examine these factors using a unique longitudinal dataset tracking the performance and survival of a sample of UK high-tech firms over thirteen years as the firms move from youth into maturity. We find that firms that survive but do not grow are characterized by difficulty in accessing complementary managerial skills in youth, while firms that grow but subsequently exit are characterized by shortfalls of specialized complementary skills during adolescence. Firms that grow and survive do not report skills shortfalls. We discuss the implications of these resource constraints for entrepreneurs' decisions to persist or exit through the life course.

This paper examines the value of alliance portfolio diversity and whether R&D human capital is the pathway through which alliance portfolio diversity influences innovation novelty. We reason that the absorptive capacity of R&D human capital determines a firm's potential gains from highly diverse alliance portfolios. Using data from the Spanish Technological Innovation Panel (PITEC) for the period 2005-2012, results support the curvilinear (inverted U-shaped) association between alliance portfolio diversity and firm innovation performance reported in studies, suggesting that not only too little, but also too much alliance portfolio diversity may be detrimental to firm innovation performance. Findings emphasise the value of alliance portfolio diversity in high-technology industries to achieve explorative performance objectives, given the technological complexity, market uncertainty and the divergent skill sets required for breakthrough innovations in these sectors. Further, we find evidence that R&D human capital plays an important role in innovation novelty by partially mediating the relationship between alliance partner diversity and firm innovation performance, emphasising the importance of internal capabilities to harness external knowledge assets. This study provides valuable insights to managers aiming to increase the effectiveness of their alliance portfolios. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, public transport systems' profitability requires a thorough diagnosis of the services provided based on users' perceptions and expectations. That is, to invest money according to users' requirements. A methodological approach, which combines an Importance-Performance Analysis and a decision tree model, is proposed as means of analyzing rail services performance in Algiers and identifying the aspects that should be prioritized for improvement actions. Three railway transit services were analyzed in Algiers: the tramway, the metro and the commuter rail. More than 450 surveys were collected per mode. After applying the proposed methodology, results show that there are lines of action common to the three services, and specific strategies that may improve customer satisfaction and customer loyalty with the three railway transit services in Algiers. This is the first full experience analysis about service quality in Algiers' railways transit modes. The proposed two-step methodology is, for the first time, applied for analyzing service quality in public transport.

To provide evidence for this conjecture, a cross-sectional study was conducted from November 2013 to January 2015. A range of 180-200 mu g of semi-solid and formed stools and 200 mu L of diarrhoeic stool samples were used for DNA extraction from microscopically E. histolytica/dispar positive samples using the QIAamp (R) DNA Stool Mini Kit according to manufacturers' instructions. Nested PCR targeting 18S ribosomal RNA gene was used. In 422 microscopically positive E. histolytica/dispar stools, molecular prevalence revealed that E. histolytica infestation was present in only 1.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.47-2.93) and E. dispar was found in 42.2% (95% CI, 37.49-46.91), while 56.2% (95% CI, 51.47-60.93) had neither E. histolytica nor E. dispar (P<0.001). We conclude that infestation with E. histolytica is rarer in our study areas than was previously believed. Hence, accurate differentiation of E. histolytica and E. dispar is crucial.

Predicting rock burst hazard with incomplete data using Bayesian networks	TUNNELLING AND UNDERGROUND SPACE TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Rock burst; Bayesian networks; Tree augmented Naive Bayes classifier; Incomplete data; Cross-validation; Sensitivity analysis; Maximum tangential stress	ROCKBURST; MODELS; TUNNELS; CRITERION; FRACTURE; STRESS	Rock burst is a dynamic process of sudden, rapid and violent release of elastic energy accumulated in rock and coal masses during underground activities. It can lead to casualties, to failure and deformation of the supporting structures, and to damage of the equipment on site; hence its prediction is of great importance. This paper presents a novel application of Bayesian networks (BNs) to predict rock burst. Five parameters Buried depth of the tunnel (H), Maximum tangential stress of surrounding rock (MTS) (sigma(0)), Uniaxial tensile strength of rock (UTS) (sigma(t)), Uniaxial compressive strength of rock (UCS) (sigma(c)) and Elastic energy index (W-et) - are adopted to construct the BN with the Tree augmented Naive Bayes classifier structure. The Expectation Maximization algorithm is employed to learn from a data set of 135 rock burst case histories, whereas the belief updating is carried out by the Junction Tree algorithm. Finally, the model is validated with 8-fold cross-validation and with another new group of incomplete case histories that had not been employed during training of the BN. Results suggest that the error rate of the proposed BN is the lowest among the traditional criteria with capability to deal with incomplete data. In addition, a sensitivity analysis shows that MTS is the most influential parameter, which could be a guidance on the rock burst prediction in the future. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Sustainability based-approach to determine the concrete type and reinforcement configuration of TBM tunnels linings. Case study: Extension line to Barcelona Airport T1	TUNNELLING AND UNDERGROUND SPACE TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						AHP; FRC; MIVES; Segmental linings; Sustainability	TRADITIONAL REINFORCEMENT; FRACTURE-BEHAVIOR; HIERARCHY PROCESS; SYSTEM APPROACH; ROOF ELEMENTS; DESIGN STAGE; SFRC SLABS; MODEL; FIBERS; PIPES	Fibre-reinforced concrete (FRC) is a suitable alternative to the traditional reinforced concrete used in the manufacture of precast segments used to line tunnels excavated with a tunnel boring machine (TBM). Moreover, its use as a structural material has been approved by several national codes and by the current fib Model Code (2010). The use of FRC in segmental linings confers several technical and economic advantages, evidenced by the fact that structural fibres have been used to partially or entirely replace reinforcing bars in many TBM tunnels built over the past 20 years or currently under construction. FRC could also have been used in other tunnels, which are currently in the planning stage or under construction. However, despite its technical suitability and approval in current codes, the use of FRC was not possible in some cases. The impediment has sometimes been an incomplete understanding of the structural behaviour of the material, but a more general motive has been that comparisons of materials have taken into account only direct material costs and have not considered indirect costs or social and environmental factors. The aim of the present research is to develop a method for analysing the sustainability of different concrete and reinforcement configurations for segmental linings of TBM tunnels using the MIVES method (a multi-criteria decision making approach for assessing sustainability). This MCDM method allows minimising subjectivity in decision making while integrating economic, environmental and social factors. The model has been used to assess the sustainability of different alternatives proposed for manufacturing the segmental tunnel lining for the extension of the rail line of Ferrocarrils de la Generalitat de Catalunya (FGC) to Terminal 1 of El Prat Airport in Barcelona.

Modelling of composting process of different organic waste at pilot scale: Biodegradability and odor emissions	WASTE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Odor concentration; Odor emission rate; Cumulative oxygen demand; Dynamic respirometer	OXYGEN-UPTAKE RATE; FOOD-WASTE; SEWAGE-SLUDGE; MANURE; RESIDUES; VALORISATION; STABILITY; BIOWASTE; PLANTS; SOIL	The composting process of six different compostable substrates and one of these with the addition of bacterial inoculums carried out in a dynamic respirometer was evaluated. Despite the heterogeneity of the compostable substrates, cumulative oxygen demand (OD, mg O-2 kg VS) was fitted adequately to an exponential regression growing until reaching a maximum in all cases. According to the kinetic constant of the reaction (K) values obtained, the wastes that degraded more slowly were those containing lignocellulosic material (green wastes) or less biodegradable wastes (sewage sludge). The odor emissions generated during the composting processes were also fitted in all cases to a Gaussian regression with R-2 values within the range 0.8-0.9. The model was validated representing real odor concentration near the maximum value against predicted odor concentration of each substrate, (R-2 = 0.9314; 95% prediction interval). The variables of maximum odor concentration (ou(E)/m(3)) and the time (h) at which the maximum was reached were also evaluated statistically using ANOVA and a post-hoc Tukey test taking the substrate as a factor, which allowed homogeneous groups to be obtained according to one or both of these variables. The maximum oxygen consumption rate or organic matter degradation during composting was directly related to the maximum odor emission generation rate (R-2 = 0.9024, 95% confidence interval) when only the organic wastes with a low content in lignocellulosic materials and no inoculated waste (HRIO) were considered. Finally, the composting of OFMSW would produce a higher odor impact than the other substrates if this process was carried out without odor control or open systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The anaerobic digestion of mixtures of sewage sludge and manure could be performed due to the similarities between both residues. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of the co-pyrolysis of sewage sludge (SS) and digested manure (DM) as a potential management technology for these residues. Pyrolysis of a sewage sludge/manure blend (50:50%) was performed at 525 degrees C in a stirred batch reactor under N-2 atmosphere. The product yields and some characteristics of the product were analyzed and compared to the results obtained in the pyrolysis of pure residues. Potential synergetic and antagonist effects during the co-pyrolysis process were evaluated. Although sewage sludge and manure seem similar in nature, there are differences in their pyrolysis product properties and distribution due to their distinct ash and organic matter composition. For the co-pyrolysis of SS and DM, the product yields did not show noticeable synergistic effects with the exception of the yields of organic compounds, being slightly higher than the predicted average, and the H-2 yield, being lower than expected. Co-pyrolysis of SS and DM could be a feasible management alternative for these residues in locations where both residues are generated, since the benefits and the drawbacks of the co-pyrolysis are similar to those of the pyrolysis of each residue.

In some EU members like Spain, approximately 83 per cent of such waste is disposed in landfills. The remaining part is classified and processed in treatment facilities so that it can later be used as recycled aggregates in the construction sector (sand, gravel, aggregates, etc.) but without much commercial success. The aim of this study is to use recycled aggregates from inert wastes (IW) in the different phases of a landfill (construction, operation and closure) with the aid of a new computer tool called LABWASTE.14. This tool incorporates the mathematical relationship among the activities of the landfill and provides as a result the economic viability of using recycled aggregates compared to aggregates from quarries. Therefore, knowing the needs of aggregates in landfills (dams, drainage layers, covering layers, collection wells, etc.) may determine the amount of IW that could be recovered. These calculations can be obtained from some of the data that is introduced (population, land physiography, etc.). Furthermore, the use of LABWASTE.14 makes it possible to reduce the demand for aggregates from quarries. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A field-scale exploratory study was conducted to investigate the potential interaction between soil texture parameters, herbicides, and soil bacterial richness and diversity. Glyphosate and bentazon were used to evaluate the herbicidal effect on bacterial community under different conditions created by clay and OC gradients in a loamy field. Metabarcoding by high-throughput sequencing of bacterial rDNA was used to estimate bacterial richness and diversity using OTUs, abundance-based coverage (ACE), Shannon diversity index, and phylogenetic diversity. In general, bacterial richness and diversity increased after bentazon application and decreased after glyphosate application. There was no significant effect for field locations with Dexter n (the ratio between clay and OC) values below 4.04 (the median of the values in the field study). The correlation coefficient (r) between bacterial richness and clay decreased after bentazon application, but increased after glyphosate application. Correlations between Dexter n and bacterial indices followed the same pattern, decreasing after bentazon application and increasing after glyphosate application. This indicated that the specific chemical nature of individual herbicides affected bacterial communities. This study reinforced the importance of including soil physical and chemical characteristics to explain the influence of pesticides on the variation in soil bacterial communities in agroecosystems.

This could be explained by either an ancient introgression of mtDNA from the Iberian blind mole T. occidentalis to T. europaea, or the existence of a differentiated taxonomic entity in northern Spain that needs to be described. In this study, we combined mitochondrial (Cytb) and nuclear (HDAC2) data to investigate these two alternative hypotheses. Based on both mitochondrial and nuclear data and an extensive geographical sampling (399 sequenced individuals), we show that the populations of T. europaea from Spain and south-western France (south of the Loire River) are phylogenetically closer to T. occidentalis than to T. europaea. The Spanish-French lineage has some morphological characters resembling more to T. occidentalis (e.g. eyes) and others resembling more to T. europaea (external measurements, mesostyle of the first upper molar). It also seems to have several distinctive dental characters, suggesting that it should be recognized as a new species. Within the three lineages, we found a marked phylogeographical pattern, with several allopatric or parapatric lineages, dating from the Pleistocene. Our genetic data combined with species distribution models support the presence of several putative glacial refugia during glacial maxima for each species.

Species boundaries were inferred from multiple lines of evidence arising from mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequencing and ecological niche modelling. Phylogenetic relationships among species were assessed by Bayesian inference and maximum-likelihood procedures. The approach was applied to the terrestrial gastropod genus Pyramidula. By examining 211 specimens collected from the Western Palaearctic region, we here identified nine putative species for this region. So far, descriptions of the morphospecies of this genus had been based exclusively on shell characters. Hence, we also studied the variation of shell characters to assess their utility to differentiate the species defined and to examine whether shell shape in Pyramidula is influenced by environmental factors. Our findings indicate that although shell characters serve to discriminate between some putative species, they are not sufficient as unique taxonomic characters and other lines of evidence are needed. According to our ecological niche modelling results, shell shape may be influenced by environmental factors.

J	Benson, DA; Aquino, T; Bolster, D; Engdahl, N; Henri, CV; Fernandez-Garcia, D				Benson, David A.; Aquino, Tomas; Bolster, Diogo; Engdahl, Nicholas; Henri, Christopher V.; Fernandez-Garcia, Daniel			A comparison of Eulerian and Lagrangian transport and non-linear reaction algorithms	ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES			English	Article						Particle tracking; Chemical reaction; Numerical dispersion; Nonlinear amplification	HETEROGENEOUS POROUS-MEDIA; CONSERVATIVE DIFFERENCE SCHEME; DISCONTINUOUS GALERKIN METHOD; PARTICLE TRACKING; SOLUTE TRANSPORT; CHEMICAL-REACTIONS; GROUNDWATER; DIFFUSION; ADVECTION; SIMULATIONS	When laboratory-measured chemical reaction rates are used in simulations at the field-scale, the models typically overpredict the apparent reaction rates. The discrepancy is primarily due to poorer mixing of chemically distinct waters at the larger scale. As a result, realistic field-scale predictions require accurate simulation of the degree of mixing between fluids. The Lagrangian particle-tracking (PT) method is a now-standard way to simulate the transport of conservative or sorbing solutes. The method's main advantage is the absence of numerical dispersion (and its artificial mixing) when simulating advection. New algorithms allow particles of different species to interact in nonlinear (e.g., bimolecular) reactions. Therefore, the PT methods hold a promise of more accurate field-scale simulation of reactive transport because they eliminate the masking effects of spurious mixing due to advection errors inherent in grid-based methods. A hypothetical field-scale reaction scenario is constructed and run in PT and Eulerian (finitevolume/ finite-difference) simulators. Grid-based advection schemes considered here include 1st-to 3rd-order spatially accurate total-variation-diminishing flux-limiting schemes, both of which are widely used in current transport/reaction codes. A homogeneous velocity field in which the Courant number is everywhere unity, so that the chosen Eulerian methods incur no error when simulating advection, shows that both the Eulerian and PT methods can achieve convergence in the L-1 (integrated concentration) norm, but neither shows stricter pointwise convergence. In this specific case with a constant dispersion coefficient and bimolecular reaction A + B -> P, the correct total amount of product is 0.221 M-A0, where M-A0 is the original mass of reactant A. When the Courant number drops, the grid-based simulations can show remarkable errors due to spurious over-and under-mixing. In a heterogeneous velocity field (keeping the same constant and isotropic dispersion), the PT simulations show an increased reaction total from 0.221 M-A0 to 0.372 M-A0 due to fluid deformation, while the 1st-order Eulerian simulations using approximate to 10(6) cells (with a classical grid Peclet number Delta x/alpha L of 10) have total product of 0.53 M-A0, or approximately twice as much additional reaction due to advection error. The 3rd-order TVD algorithm fares better, with total product of 0.394 M-A0, or about 1.14 times the increased reaction total. A very strict requirement on grid Peclet numbers for Eulerian simulations will be required for realistic reactions because of their nonlinear nature. We analytically estimate the magnitude of the effect for the end-member cases of very fast and very slow reactions and show that in either case, the mass produced is proportional to 1/root Pe, where Pe is the Peclet number. Therefore, extra mass is produced according to root D, where the dispersion includes any numerical dispersion error. We test two PT methods, one that kills particles upon reaction and another that decrements a particle's mass. For the bimolecular reaction studied here, the computational demands of the particle-killing methods are much smaller than, and the particle-number-preserving algorithm are on par with, the fastest Eulerian methods.

Sex differences in lipid profiles and treatment utilization among young adults with acute myocardial infarction: Results from the VIRGO study	AMERICAN HEART JOURNAL			English	Article							DENSITY-LIPOPROTEIN CHOLESTEROL; AMI PATIENTS VIRGO; CARDIOVASCULAR-DISEASE; GENDER-DIFFERENCES; LDL-CHOLESTEROL; HDL CHOLESTEROL; PLASMA-LIPIDS; RECOVERY ROLE; HEALTH-STATUS; EVENTS	Background Young women with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) have higher mortality risk than similarly aged men. An adverse lipid profile is an important risk factor for cardiovascular outcomes after AMI, but little is known about whether young women with AMI have a higher-risk lipid pattern than men. We characterized sex differences in lipid profiles and treatment utilization among young adults with AMI. Methods A total of 2,219 adults with AMI (1,494 women) aged 18-55 years were enrolled from 103 hospitals in the United States (2008-2012). Serum lipids and lipoprotein subclasses were measured 1 month after discharge. Results More than 90% of adults were discharged on a statin, but less than half received a high-intensity dose and 12% stopped taking treatments by 1 month. For both men and women, the median of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol was reduced to <100 mg/dL 1 month after discharge for AMI, but high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol remained <40 mg/dL. Multivariate regression analyses showed that young women had favorable lipoprotein profiles compared with men: women had higher HDL cholesterol and HDL large particle, but lower total cholesterol-to-HDL cholesterol ratio and LDL small particle. Conclusions Young women with AMI had slightly favorable lipid and lipoprotein profiles compared with men, suggesting that difference in lipid and lipoprotein may not be a major contributor to sex differences in outcomes after AMI. In both men and women, statin remained inadequately used, and low HDL cholesterol level was a major lipid abnormality.

For this, the risk factors are reconstructed at the end of each reading of monthly data. We argue that, over time, the evaluation of a company may change as a result of variations in its market price, size or book price, and we are aware that the F&F model does not accurately reflect these dynamics. Our results show that the adapted model is able to capture the behaviour of a greater number of stocks than the original F&F model and risk factors are more significant when building them through our procedure. In addition, we carry out these adaptations during a period of instability in financial markets.

Impacts of optimal energy storage deployment and network reconfiguration on renewable integration level in distribution systems	APPLIED ENERGY			English	Article						Energy storage; Distributed generation; Network reinforcement; Network switching; Renewable energy sources; Stochastic mixed integer linear programming	DISTRIBUTION GRIDS; POWER-GENERATION; ALGORITHM; LOSSES; UNITS; DG; RELIABILITY; CONSUMPTION; MICROGRIDS; RESOURCES	Nowadays, there is a wide consensus about integrating more renewable energy sources-RESs to solve a multitude of global concerns such as meeting an increasing demand for electricity, reducing energy security and heavy dependence on fossil fuels for energy production, and reducing the overall carbon footprint of power production. Framed in this context, the coordination of RES integration with energy storage systems (ESSs), along with the network's switching capability and/or reinforcement, is expected to significantly improve system flexibility, thereby increasing the capability of the system in accommodating large-scale RES power. Hence, this paper presents a novel mechanism to quantify the impacts of network switching and/or reinforcement as well as deployment of ESSs on the level of renewable power integrated in the system. To carry out this analysis, a dynamic and multi-objective stochastic mixed integer linear programming (S-MILP) model is developed, which jointly takes the optimal deployment of RES-based DGs and ESSs into account in coordination with distribution network reinforcement and/or reconfiguration. The IEEE 119-bus test system is used as a case study. Numerical results clearly show the capability of ESS deployment in dramatically increasing the level of renewable DGs integrated in the system. Although case-dependent, the impact of network reconfiguration on RES power integration is not significant. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Ruiz, GR; Bandera, CF				Ramos Ruiz, German; Fernandez Bandera, Carlos			Analysis of uncertainty indices used for building envelope calibration	APPLIED ENERGY			English	Article						Multi-zone calibration; Energy simulation; Uncertainty analysis; Multi-objective optimisation; Genetic algorithm (NSGA-II)	ENERGY SIMULATION-MODELS; GENETIC ALGORITHM; OPTIMIZATION; DESIGN; SYSTEM	Nowadays there is a growing concern about climate change and the global warming effect produced by the concentration of greenhouse gases (GHG). At the Paris climate conference (COP21), 195 countries adopted a global climate agreement, limiting global warming to well below 2 degrees C. Buildings are large producers of GHG and therefore international standards such as ISO 50001 focus on improving their energy performance, including energy efficiency, use and consumption. To achieve this goal it is important to have a detailed knowledge of the thermal behaviour of buildings. The International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol (IPMVP), proposes a calibrated simulation model (Option D) to gather this knowledge and to determine the savings associated with Energy Conservation Measures (ECMs). This paper improves the calibration methodology proposed by Ramos et al. (2016) [1], solving the limitations regarding the number of thermal zones and the use of free-floating time periods. Through a real case-study that guides the process, the paper explains how to achieve a calibrated Building Energy Simulation (BES) model using an optimisation process based on a meta-heuristic strategy (genetic algorithm - NSGA-II). Different uncertainty indices such as: CV(RMSE) and Goodness of Fit (GOF) are used as objective function to obtain the calibrated model. These indices, frequently used to measure the accuracy of models, are combined to provide a double possibility to find the best solution, as they are an objective function and a model accuracy measure.

The dynamic melting concept is a new heat transfer enhancement technique which consists of recirculating the liquid PCM during the melting process with a pump and thus increasing the overall heat transfer coefficient as a result of the dominance of the forced convection. The HTF flow rate was kept constant at 1 I/min and four different PCM flow rates of 0, 0.5, 1 and 2 1/min were tested. Results from the experimental analysis showed enhancements up to 65.3% on the melting period, up to 56.4% on the effectiveness, and 66% on the heat transfer rates when the PCM flow rate was twice the HTF flow rate. From these experiments, it can be concluded that dynamic melting is an effective technique for enhancing heat transfer during melting of PCM. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

An analytical optimization of thermal energy storage for electricity cost reduction in solar thermal electric plants	APPLIED ENERGY			English	Article						Solar thermal electric plant; Parametric model; Thermal energy storage; Cost optimization; Parabolic trough; Fresnel	POWER-PLANTS; CSP PLANTS; DESIGN; TECHNOLOGIES; SYSTEMS	Solar Thermal Electric (STE) plants can integrate Thermal Energy Storage (TES) in order to generate electricity when the energy source (Sun radiation) has vanished. TES technology has become a very important asset for this type of renewable energy source, but it has induced a rise in electricity cost in many cases. One of the reasons is the need of larger solar fields as the TES capacity increases because the solar field has to provide thermal power both to generate electricity and to charge the storage. The economic effects of improving the plant performance seem to have some internal complexities that must be investigated covering the internal relations among the main parts of a STE plant: the solar field, the power block and the energy storage. This paper presents an analytical study of these relations aimed at deriving a better understanding of the cost/performance behavior of STE plants. As the power block is a mature and commercial technology with well-established efficiencies and specific costs (in $/W, for instance), it has been taken as the reference element in modelling the plant. The other parts of the plant, i.e., the solar field and the energy storage, have been characterized in cost and energy management by a set of high-level parameters. Of course, a coarse definition cannot give very accurate results for a specific design, but it can be the guideline for the selection and sizing of a plant. It is worth noting that each type of solar thermal power plant has a different parametric scenario, corresponding to its essential design window. In this paper, comparisons among plants with different parametric scenarios are restricted to one-axis concentration solar fields, where the coarse model is easily characterized. The results show that the optimum plant configuration, in terms of TES capacity and solar field size, depends on the solar field and TES costs relative to power block cost. Moreover, it is shown that some parametric scenarios always lead to an increase in the cost of electricity when the energy storage capacity is enlarged. On the contrary, parametric scenarios associated to cheaper solar fields yield a much better economic result when TES is embodied in the plant. Additionally, TES efficiency is also identified as a parameter with high impact in the performance of the whole system. This result seems obvious, but the model gives numerical values that can help to optimize the selection process in a project. For instance, it is assessed that the lower the TES efficiency, the greater the relevance of reducing solar field costs is in order to obtain low electricity generation costs. As a general conclusion, the model points out that Fresnel-type solar fields are much better suited than parabolic trough collectors for integrating thermal energy storage. This implies that Fresnel plants present a higher potential to cover the peaks of electricity demand, which results into bigger profits. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Trapero, JR; Horcajada, L; Linares, JJ; Lobato, J				Trapero, Juan R.; Horcajada, Laura; Linares, Jose J.; Lobato, Justo			Is microbial fuel cell technology ready? An economic answer towards industrial commercialization	APPLIED ENERGY			English	Article						Microbial fuel cells; Economic assessment; Electrode; Wastewater	WASTE-WATER TREATMENT; ELECTRICITY PRODUCTION; POWER-GENERATION; SCALE-UP; ENERGY; SYSTEM; MFC; PERFORMANCE; ENHANCE; STACKS	Over the last decade, Microbial Fuel Cells (MFCs) have experienced significant scientific and technological development, to the point of becoming close to commercialization. One key assessment that clearly establishes whether one technology can fully enter the market is the profitability demonstration. For this demonstration, classical evaluation criteria for investment decisions such as the Net Present Value and the Internal Rate of Return can be applied to a given proposal. This paper presents an economic assessment of a microbial fuel cell in a juice processing plant. Three different scenarios, optimistic, pessimistic and most likely scenarios based on the maximum power density of the cell on two basic MFC cases (cathodes with and without Pt, respectively), were studied and compared to the conventional activated sludge process. The results show that under most of the scenarios under consideration, including the pessimistic one, MFC is a more attractive option. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis was performed with respect to the electrode area, and the annual growth rate of the electricity pricing has revealed that the electrode area parameter is the most influential, reducing the MFC profitability for larger electrode areas, whereas the higher the annual growth rates of the electricity price, the higher the MFC profits.

Streamlined life cycle analysis for assessing energy and exergy performance as well as impact on the climate for landfill gas utilization technologies	APPLIED ENERGY			English	Article						Biogas; Fuel cell; Cogeneration; Hydrogen; Amine scrubbing; Life-cycle analysis	BIOGAS UPGRADING TECHNOLOGIES; ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT; FUEL-CELLS; GENERATION; OPTIMIZATION; SYSTEM; PLANT	Three landfill gas (LFG) valorization technologies were compared using energy and exergy efficiency and a streamlined Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA) method. The technologies were (i) steam reforming and hydrogen utilization in an in situ cogeneration fuel cell (SR-IS-FCC), (ii) biogas utilization in an in situ gas engine cogeneration plant (IS-GEC), and (iii) amine scrubbing and biomethane utilization in an ex situ gas engine cogeneration plant (AS-ES-GEC). The SR-IS-FCC alternative recorded the highest exergy efficiency and savings in cumulative energy demand (CED), and the lowest global warming potential (GWP) when all the heat is utilized in situ; otherwise, the highest exergy efficiency and the lowest GWP and CED were associated with the AS-ES-GEC alternative. The results indicate that AS-ES-GEC is the preferential choice when heat cannot be utilized in situ. Otherwise, SR-IS-FCC records the best values for the three criteria, and the AS-ES-GEC technology is the least interesting alternative. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Thermochemical energy storage by consecutive reactions for higher efficient concentrated solar power plants (CSP): Proof of concept	APPLIED ENERGY			English	Article						Thermal energy storage (TES); Thermochemical materials (TCM); High temperature; Concentrated solar power plant (CSP); Consecutive reactions	FEO/FE3O4 REDOX REACTIONS; HYDROGEN-PRODUCTION; HIGH-TEMPERATURE; STEAM-GASIFICATION; CHEMICAL REACTOR; CARBOTHERMAL REDUCTION; THERMAL-DISSOCIATION; SULFATE REDUCTION; ELEMENTAL SULFUR; BARIUM-SULFATE	Concentrated solar power plants (CSP) combined with thermal energy storage (TES) offers the benefit to provide continuous electricity production by renewable energy feed. There are several TES technologies to be implemented, being the thermochemical energy storage the less studied and the most attractive since its volumetric energy density is 5 and 10 times higher than latent and sensible TES, respectively. Thermochemical energy storage technology is based on reversible chemical reactions, also named thermochemical materials (TCM). One of the main challenges of TCM is to achieve a proper reversibility of the reactions, which in practical conditions leads to lower efficiencies than the theoretically expected. A new concept based on changing from reversible TCM reactions towards TCM consecutive reactions aims to eliminate reversibility problems and therefore improve the overall efficiency. Consecutive TCM reactions can either be based in one cycle, where reactants are needed to feed the reaction, or two coupled cycles which offer the possibility to work without any extra mass reactants input. The plausibility of the implementation of both concepts in CSP is detailed in this paper and case studies are described for each one. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

LARVAE; DISEASE; GROWTH; REQUIREMENTS	The concept of nutritional programming raises the interesting possibility of directing specific metabolic pathways or functions in juvenile fish, for example, to improve the use of substitutes to fishmeal and oil, and hence to promote sustainability in aquaculture. The aim of the study was to determine effects of early nutritional stimuli of gilthead seabream larvae and check if nutritional programming of gilthead sea bream is possible between 16days post hatching (dph) and 26 dph. A trial was conducted to determine the effects of early nutritional stimuli of gilthead seabream larvae. Five experimental microdiets (pellet size <250m) were formulated containing five different proportions of a marine lipid source rich in long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA) and two vegetable lipid sources rich in linolenic and linoleic acids. The results of this study demonstrate that dietary n-3 LC-PUFA levels increased larval growth and survival affecting 6 desaturase gen (fads2) expression and retinal neurons density. However, the high mortalities obtained along on-growing in fish fed low n-3 LC-PUFA at 16 dph constrained the feasibility of nutritional programming of gilthead seabream during this late developmental window and needs to be further investigated.

Development of a measure to evaluate gains among spanish dementia caregivers: The gains associated with caregiving (GAC) scale	ARCHIVES OF GERONTOLOGY AND GERIATRICS			English	Article						Dementia; Informal caregiving; Gains; Scale development	POSITIVE ASPECTS; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; PHYSICAL HEALTH; OLDER-ADULTS; MIDLIFE; GENERATIVITY; METAANALYSIS; INSTRUMENT; STRAIN; YOUNG	Background: The study is aimed at developing a new measure devised to evaluate gains associated with caregiving for a person with dementia. Methods: We conducted two studies with Spanish informal caregivers. In Study 1 a total of 152 participants responded to a preliminary set of 62 items referred to gains related with caregiving. After exploring their psychometric properties, we studied its factor structure, concurrent validity, and internal consistency reliability by means of, respectively, an exploratory factor analysis (EFA), its correlation with the similar measures, and Cronbach's alpha coefficients. In Study 2 we undertook a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to obtain further evidence regarding the scale dimensionality and we studied its construct validity by calculating its correlations with the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI), the Geriatric Depression Scale -Short Form (GDS-SF), and the Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS). Results: The final version of the Gains Associated with Caregiving (GAC) scale comprised 22 items, all of which seemed to belong to the same factor according to both the EFA and the CFA. The correlation between the GAC scale and similar measures was statistically significant and strong, and the Cronbach's a coefficient was 0.95. Statistically significant correlations in the expected direction were found between the GAC and the ZBI, the GDS-SF, and the SWLS. Conclusions: The high internal consistency of the GAC scale, and its adequate concurrent and construct validity suggest that it is a suitable instrument for evaluating gains among Spanish informal dementia caregivers.

Distance labelings: a generalization of Langford sequences	ARS MATHEMATICA CONTEMPORANEA			English	Article						Langford sequence; distance l; labeling; distance J-labeling; delta-sequence; delta-set	SKOLEM SEQUENCES; INTERSECTION SPECTRUM	A Langford sequence of order m and defect d can be identified with a labeling of the vertices of a path of order 2 m in which each label from d up to d + m - 1 appears twice and in which the vertices that have been labeled with k are at distance k. In this paper, we introduce two generalizations of this labeling that are related to distances. The basic idea is to assign nonnegative integers to vertices in such a way that if n vertices (n > 1) have been labeled with k then they are mutually at distance k. We study these labelings for some well known families of graphs. We also study the existence of these labelings in general. Finally, given a sequence or a set of nonnegative integers, we study the existence of graphs that can be labeled according to this sequence or set.	[Lopez, S.

Nonetheless, early ASL-English bilinguals retrieved fewer words in a letter fluency task in their dominant language compared to monolingual English speakers with equal vocabulary level. This finding demonstrates that reduced vocabulary size and/or frequency of use cannot completely account for bilingual disadvantages in verbal fluency. Instead, retrieval difficulties likely reflect between-language interference. Furthermore, it suggests that the two languages of bilinguals compete for selection even when they are expressed with distinct articulators.

Several studies using behavioral or electrophysiological measures have demonstrated that this effect is modulated by the degree of formal overlap between translations. However, it has never been tested with a psychophysiological measure such as pupillometry. In the present study we replicate the cognate facilitation effect by examining reaction times and pupil responses. Our results endorse pupillometry as a promising tool for bilingual research, and confirm the modulation of the cognate effect by the degree of formal similarity.

This is pertinent as the Triptocare study did not show that urinary prostate cancer antigen-3 (PCA3) score was a reliable marker of cancer stage in advanced prostate cancer and was not useful for assessing response 6 months after initiation of ADT with triptorelin 22.5 mg. Patients and Methods An international, multicentre, non-interventional, observational, longitudinal, prospective study involving patients from the Triptocare study. CRPC status of patients was collected for up to 3 years from ADT initiation. Patient treatment and assessments were at the investigator's discretion. Co-primary endpoints were rate of CRPC at 3 years after initiating ADT and the median time to CRPC. An exploratory endpoint was the association of Triptocare baseline variables (including TMPRSS2-ERG and PCA3 scores) and PCA3 score at Triptocare last value available with CRPC onset. Results Of the 325 patients in the Triptocare study safety population, 180 patients were enrolled in the Triptocare LT study (102 received continuous and 78 received intermittent ADT). CRPC rates at 3 years were 24/102 (23.5%) and 6/78 (7.7%) patients in the continuous and intermittent ADT groups, respectively. The median time to CRPC was not reached for either group. PCA3 score status at baseline was the only variable associated with a higher risk of progression to CRPC in both the intermittent and continuous ADT groups; compared with a baseline PCA3 score of >= 35, a PCA3 score below the level of quantification had a hazard ratio (HR) of 20.04 ([95% confidence interval (CI) 2.71-148.34] and a HR of 9.44 [95% CI 2.39-37.27], respectively). Baseline metastatic disease and testosterone level were additionally associated with progression to CRPC in the continuous ADT population (HR 5.20, 95% CI 1.68-16.06 and HR 0.995, 95% CI 0.991-0.999, respectively). Conclusion In men with locally advanced or metastatic prostate cancer, a PCA3 score of >= 35 at the time of initiating ADT may predict a lower risk of developing CRPC in the following 3 years.

Non-linear static procedures applied to high-rise residential URM buildings	BULLETIN OF EARTHQUAKE ENGINEERING			English	Article						Unreinforced masonry; Push-over; Non-linear static procedures; Multi stripe analysis; Vulnerability	CAPACITY SPECTRUM METHOD; CULTURAL-HERITAGE; VULNERABILITY; BARCELONA	In this work, the vulnerability of an unreinforced masonry building, evaluated on the one hand by using the incremental dynamic analysis, and on the other hand by using nine representative non-linear static incremental procedures, is compared. For comparison reasons among the different non-linear static procedures, the obtained incremental dynamic analyses results are used as reference values. The aim of this analysis is to evaluate the applicability and reliability of the diverse non-linear static procedures for unreinforced masonry buildings, and to propose modifications oriented to improve their use in this typology of structures. For this purpose, a fully representative unreinforced masonry building of the dominating building type in the Eixample district of Barcelona, is analyzed. Furthermore, the conditional spectrum approach procedure has been applied with the aim to conveniently define the seismic demand. Regarding the definition of the fragility curves, two different methodologies were used for each non-linear static procedure and incremental dynamic analyzes. Subsequently, the corresponding damage indices as well as the damage curves were calculated and compared for the different considered peak ground acceleration values. The results of this comparison seem to confirm that the damage curves obtained by performing the NSP and by applying the Risk-UE methodology overestimate the damage corresponding to low values of the PGA and underestimate the damage for higher values of the PGA.

Cadaveric and radiologic study of the anatomical variations of the prostatic arteries: A review of the literature and a new classification proposal with application to prostatectomy	CLINICAL ANATOMY			English	Article						prostatic artery; prostatic arterial embolization; vascular variations; benign prostatic hyperplasia	CONE-BEAM CT; EMBOLIZATION; ANGIOGRAPHY; HYPERPLASIA; DISEASES	Development of prostatic arterial embolization (PAE) to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) has raised interest in the variations of the prostatic arteries (PA). The aim of this study is to identify these vascular variations, to compare them with previous data, and to propose a simple classification. Ten adult male pelvis sides from embalmed cadavers were dissected, ages 69 to 92 years, and 10 PA were examined. In a retrospective analysis of 34 DSA pelvic angiographies on 28 patients aged 50 to 90 years, 48 PA were identified. A total of 58 PA were therefore analyzed. Six types are defined. Type I: PA originates from the anterior division (AD) of the internal iliac artery (IIA), 20.7%; Type II: PA emerges from the obturator artery (OA), 5.2%; type III: PA arises from the gluteal-pudendal trunk (GPT), 27.5%; Type IV: PA originates from the internal pudendal artery (IPA), 29.3%; Type V: PA comes from the middle rectal artery (MRA), 15.5%. Other origins, not observed in our sample but described in the literature, were amalgamated under Type VI. The AD/GPT/IPA stem is the main source of the PA. Analysis of the definitions of IIA branches and the associated terminology is necessary for interpreting the results reported by several authors on different samples, but in general the results fit the meta-analysis well. A new, simple, and complete classification for vascular variations of the PA is proposed. Clin. Anat. 30:71-80, 2017. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

This article discusses some of the data analysis methodologies that define the onset of steady state conditions, which are widely reported in the literature but poorly defined. The effects of using different methods to determine the onset of the steady state performance, and to correct thermocouple data so as to account for radiative effects, are also presented. Results show that using a combination of CO and NO emissions with free-board temperatures (at multiple axial positions) is more effective than other emissions, using temperatures (only) or the fuel burning rate (kg m(-2) s(-1)). An important indicator is to analyze the percentile deviation of temperatures and emissions, compared to only using the time evolution of these variables. To characterize the significance of correcting thermocouple data for radiative (wall) losses, two numerical models (aspirated and bare bead) were compared. Radiative effects on thermocouples were found to be most prominent nearer to the downstream secondary air inlet due to the cooler wall temperature. Due to the likely radiative effects from freeboard deflectors, the sensitivity of these outcomes to the presence of downstream deflectors is also presented.

(1995) define the elasticity for non negative random variables as the reversed proportional failure rate (RPFR). Veres-Ferrer and Pavia (2012, 2014b) interpret it in economic terms, extending its definition to variables that can also take negative values, and briefly present the role of elasticity in characterizing probability distributions. This paper highlights a set of properties demonstrated by elasticity, which shows many similar properties to the reverse hazard function. This paper pays particular attention to studying the increase/decrease and the speed of change of the elasticity function. These are important properties because of the characterizing role of elasticity, which makes it possible to introduce our hypotheses and knowledge about the random process in a more meaningful and intuitive way. As a general rule, it is observed the need for distinguishing between positive and negative areas of the support.

New remains of Diplocynodon (Crocodylia: Diplocynodontidae) from the Early Miocene of the Iberian Peninsula	COMPTES RENDUS PALEVOL			English	Article						Fossil crocodiles; Alligatoroidea; Diplocynodon ratelii; Cranial anatomy; Catalonia; Spain	VALLES-PENEDES BASIN; LATE NEOGENE; ELS-CASOTS; PHYLOGENETIC-RELATIONSHIPS; ALLIGATOROID DIPLOCYNODON; MIDDLE MIOCENE; SP NOV.; FRANCE; SPAIN; MAMMALIA	We describe crocodylian remains from the Early Miocene (MN4) site of Els Casots ( Subirats, Valles-Penedes Basin, NE of the Iberian Peninsula). Referral to Diplocynodon (Alligatoroidea: Diplocynodontidae) is justified by several cranial and postcranial features, including: (1) the subequal and confluent alveoli of the maxilla (fourth and fifth) and dentary (third and fourth); (2) the position of the foramen aereum on the quadrate; (3) the small and ventrally reflected medial hemicondyle of the quadrate; (4) the distinct dorsoventral step on the frontal; and (5) the bipartite ventral osteoderms. Multiple morphological features are consistent with an attribution to Diplocynodon ratelii, previously known from the Early Miocene (MN2) of France, and discount an alternative attribution to other species of the genus, including Diplocynodon ungeri from the Middle Miocene (MN5) of Austria. The described material from Els Casots is smaller in size than the French material of D. ratelii, possibly reflecting an earlier ontogenetic stage. The described remains constitute the first report of D. ratelii and the youngest record of Diplocynodon in the Iberian Peninsula, where only Diplocynodon muelleri and Diplocynodon tormis have been previously reported. The presence of Diplocynodon further supports the lacustrine depositional environment previously inferred for Els Casots and also indicates a relatively high temperature.

In this study, we describe for the first time a large portion of a parietal bone (ATD6-100/168). The morphology of the fractures on the bones is compatible with a peri-mortem trauma. The superior parietal areas are flat. There is a large parietal foramen and one smaller accessory parietal foramen. Middle meningeal vessels are not particularly developed, but they are distributed in both anterior and posterior districts, with the parietal vasculature originating from the posterior branch. The meningeal vessels show multiple minor connections with the pericranial and diploic vascular systems. The diploe is not particularly developed, and large diploic channels are not detected. The bone is thin when compared with adult fossil humans, and equivalent to juvenile values. All these characters suggest that the parietal ATD6-100/168 probably belonged to a juvenile individual, with plesiomorphic endocranial traits similar to those described for H. ergaster/erectus. The derived temporal, maxillary and dental traits in Homo antecessor and the primitive parietal morphology further point to distinct (mosaic) patterns of morphological evolution of face and braincase.

Results indicate an unconstrained transport strategy in all levels and all size-weight categories. However, we also found differences in the skeletal distribution of medium-sized and large animals, which may be due to different transport strategies. These characteristics suggest that the superposition of transport and occupation events could be responsible for our results. In addition, we applied the same analysis to Hadza assemblages, which revealed similar results to those found at Abric Romani. The most striking feature of the Hadza assemblages examined is the superposition of transport events as a result of successive occupation/deposition events. This suggests that the transport strategies used by Neanderthals at Abric Romani are also characterized by a high degree of diversity in transport decisions. (C) 2016 Academie des sciences.

The individual sensors show nearly theoretical behavior over a wide concentration range. The applicability of this probe is first demonstrated on a Fe-Zn galvanic couple, as it shows excellent performance in these simultaneous model experiments. In addition, linear scans recorded over a cut edge of coated galvanized steel evidence the complementary information, gathered on the electrochemical behavior of the corroding sample, and adumbrates promising and feasible applications of multi-barrel microelectrodes in corrosion research.

An Al coating on a ground or grit blasted substrate, and Al-Al2O3/Al coating on ground mild carbon steel have been compared. The electrochemical results showed that the coatings protect the substrate for immersion times >2000 h due to the dense structure obtained by Al and Al-Al2O3. The electrolyte reaches the substrate only after 2000 h of immersion without wetting completely the coating/substrate interface. Coatings have resisted 3000 h of salt fog test. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In vivo (human and animal), and in vitro tests are important approaches for estimating the bioavailability of toxic and essential compounds to humans. An overview on in vivo and in vitro bioavailability assays for releasing selenium and selenium species in foodstuffs is summarized. Se and Se species content in a foodstuff critically influence Se bioavailability and bioactivity to humans and animals. Se bioavailability is affected by foodstuff-matrix major composition and minor components. Foodstuffs processing and/or treatments could enhancement or decrease Se bioavailability. Experimental conditions such as the selection of healthy status of examined people (in in vivo humans approaches), the selection of animal model (in vivo animals approaches), or the selection of GI conditions (in in vitro tests) could determines the results. Thus, international standardized protocol for in vivo and in vitro approaches assessment is mandatory.

The maintenance of adequate physical function is recognized as a key element of healthy aging. In recent years, scientific evidence has increased concerning the ability of lipids, in particular omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs), to positively influence muscle and overall physical function in older patients. The article will critically review observational as well as intervention studies on this topic, and it will elucidate the potential biological mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of n-3 PUFA on physical function.Recent findingsObservational studies and clinical trials performed in healthy older patients and in older patients with chronic diseases mostly found positive effects of n-3 PUFA on muscle metabolism, muscle strength and in general physical function.SummaryAlthough the use of n-3 PUFA might represent an important intervention to preserve physical function in older adults, several key questions still need to be answered. Above all, large randomized controlled trials should be performed to confirm the utility of n-3 PUFA as therapeutic agents to prevent and treat physical function decline in old age.

Only five disorders were considered: borderline, obsessive-compulsive, antisocial, narcissistic, and schizotypal. Significant deficits are observed in decision-making, working memory, inhibition, and flexibility. Relevant data for the remaining personality disorders have not yet been published in relation to the executive functions.SummaryPeople with personality disorders could present a pattern of neurocognitive alterations that suggest a specific impairment of the prefrontal areas. The executive dysfunctions could partially explain the behavioral alterations in people with personality disorders.Further research should adopt broader considerations of effects of comorbidity and clinical heterogeneity, include community samples and, possibly, longitudinal designs with samples of youth.

Advanced drug-delivery systems attempt to control the site of action and release rate and act by means of either a physiological or a chemical trigger. In this sense, stimuliresponsive biomaterials are of special interest for application as components of drug-delivery devices. This review discusses the use of elastin-like recombinamers (ELR) in drug-delivery systems. These biopolymers possess special properties that encompass biodegradability, bioactivity and stimuli-responsiveness. Their tailormade design using recombinant DNA technologies allows an absolute control of their amino acid sequence and design of the most appropriate macromolecule for each application. Firstly, devices based on monomeric elastinlike recombinamers which have been chemically modified to attach functionalities that enable us to follow or direct their distribution or anticancer drugs in an attempt to improve drug-conjugate uptake are described. Secondly, ELRs that form part of nanoparticles as drug carriers will be studied in their different versions, including nanoparticles chemically reinforced by interchain cross-linking, nanoparticles formed by self-assembly of chemically modified ELRs to achieve amphiphilic properties and multifunctional composites made up of nanoparticles coated with ELRs. Finally, recent advances in the area of 3D platforms for drug delivery, comprising interconnected hydrogels and ELR-based coacervates in the form of depots, will be reviewed.

In fact, even in an unconscious way, the mankind always applied enzyme-based bioprocesses for example in beer brewing, bread baking, and cheese and wine making. Nevertheless, throughout the centuries, process improvement or design and implementation of novel approaches has been consistently performed, and especially in recent years, significant advances in protein engineering and biocatalyst design have been achieved and applied in food sector. Consequently, an updated overview regarding the applications of enzymes in the food sector and of progresses made, namely, within the scope of obtainment of more efficient biocatalysts through structural modification, protein engineering and immobilization of enzymes will be provided. The main scope of targeted improvements deal with the technological aspects related to the most representative strategies to achieve enzymes with enhanced thermal and operational stability, improved specific activity, modification of pH-activity profiles, and increased product specificity, among others.

However, the utility of Ki-67 determination in cytological material and its association to PNET prognosis are under discussion. MethodsWe have retrospectively reviewed all cases of EUS-FNA cytology of pancreatic lesions performed in the Hospital Clinico San Carlos (Madrid) between 2006 and 2016. We have analyzed the potential association between the Ki-67 estimation in PNET cytological material and patient outcomes. ResultsWe identified 24 PNET cases. Mean age was 56.8 years and most patients were males (54%). PNETs were mainly located in the head and tail of the pancreas and the mean tumor size was 36 mm. Cell block from cytology was available in 12 cases (50%), and there were 19 G1, 2 G2, and 3 G3 tumors. All cases graded as G2 (2 patients) or G3 (three patients) on cytology were stage IV, and the 19 cases graded as G1 ranged from stages IA to IV. All patients with G2 tumors on cytology died due to PNET. Of the three patients with G3 lesions, two died of disease and the other died 2 months after diagnosis from causes other than PNET. 78% of the patients with G1 tumors are stable and currently being followed-up. ConclusionHigher Ki-67 index in cytology specimens portends a worse outcome, although some G1 tumors may progress or cause death. Diagn. Cytopathol. 2017;45:29-35. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Percentage of body fat in adolescents with Down syndrome: Estimation from skinfolds	DISABILITY AND HEALTH JOURNAL			English	Article						Trisomy 21; Body composition; Bod-Pod; ISAK; Fat mass	AIR-DISPLACEMENT PLETHYSMOGRAPHY; PREDICTION EQUATIONS; MENTAL-RETARDATION; PHYSICAL-FITNESS; CHILDREN; ADULTS; THICKNESS; DENSITY; INDIVIDUALS; ACCURACY	Background: Adolescents with Down syndrome (DS) have a unique morphology and body shape, and this needs to be taken into account when assessing body fat percentage (BF%). Objective: To develop a predictive equation from anthropometric variables (skinfolds) for estimating BF% in adolescents with DS. Methods: Twenty-three adolescents with DS (7 girls, 16 boys) participated in the study; seven skinfold measurements were taken (biceps, triceps, subscapular, supraspinale, abdominal, front thigh, and medial calf), circumferences and diameters were measured following ISAK recommendations. Total body volume (and then body density) was measured with air displacement plethysmography (ADP); BF% was then calculated. Correlation between anthropometry data and BF% by ADP, and stepwise regression analyses were applied to develop a specific prediction equation. Results: All the skinfolds, BMI, hip, waist and thigh circumferences correlated with BF% and were included in the regression analysis; sex and triceps were added into the model (R-2 = 0.89, p < 0.05). Therefore the proposed equation computed as follows: BF % = (0.97 TR) - (8.869.SEX) + 15.6 where TR is triceps skinfolds (mm) and SEX is equal to 0 for female and 1 for male. Conclusions: The proposed prediction equation is recommended for the assessment of BF% in adolescents with DS as it is the only one specifically developed and validated in this unique population. It is a cheap, reliable and accessible method that removes the need for use of expensive equipment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Reliability and convergent validity of the 6-min run test in young adults with Down syndrome	DISABILITY AND HEALTH JOURNAL			English	Article						Disability; Fitness; Measurement	TEST-RETEST RELIABILITY; CARDIORESPIRATORY FITNESS; MENTAL-RETARDATION; PHYSICAL-FITNESS; HEART-RATE; CROSS-VALIDATION; AEROBIC FITNESS; TEST BATTERY; WALK TEST; JOG-WALK	Background: There is limited evidence about the psychometric properties of field tests to measure cardiorespiratory fitness in people with Down syndrome. Objective: This study aimed at analyzing the reliability and convergent validity of the 6-min run test when performed by young adults with Down syndrome (DS). Methods: In a cross-sectional design fifty-one young adults with DS (mean age 26.20 +/- 7.14 years; 54% women) performed the 6-min run test and the 16-min shuttle run test twice with a one week-interval between test and retest. Results: The 6-min run test offered high reliability for the distances covered (ICC: 0.974; 95% CI: 0.955-0.985) and good reliability when comparing peak heart rate values obtained in the test and retest (ICC: 0.870; 95% CI: 0.772-0.926). A significant correlation between the 6-min run test and the 16-min shuttle run test was observed for the test (r = 0.705; Sig = 0.001), and retest phases (r = 0.651; Sig = 0.001). The relationship between the estimated maximal oxygen consumption (VO2 max) peak after the performance of the 16-min shuttle run test and the distance covered by the 6-min run test was statistically significant (r > 0.7). No significant differences were found between the equations that estimate VO2 peak for both tests. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the 6-min run test shows high test/retest reliability and moderate to moderately high convergent validity when performed by adults with DS.

However, its prevalence among people with disabilities in the basic activities of daily living (ADLs) is unknown. Objectives: The objectives were to: (1) examine the prevalence of the homebound status among middle-aged and older adults with disabilities in ADLs, and (2) identify its clinical, functional, and environmental determinants. Methods: This study included 221 community-dwelling subjects, aged >= 50 years, who applied for long-term care services at the Office for Legal Certification of Long-term Care Need of Coruna (Spain). Each subject had a disability in ADLs and was interviewed by a trained examiner in the subject's home. The participants were considered homebound if they remained inside their home during the previous week. Measures: Demographic, clinical, functional, and environmental factors. Multiple logistic regression was used to determine the factors associated with homebound status. Results: The prevalence of homebound status was 39.8%. A multivariate analysis revealed that the presence of architectural bathers at the home entrance (stairs [OR: 6.67, p < 0.001] or a heavy door [OR: 2.83, p = 0.023]), walking ability limitations (OR: 3.26, p = 0.006), and higher age (OR: 1.05, p = 0.04) were associated with homebound status. Conclusions: Homebound status is a highly prevalent problem among middle-aged and older adults with disabilities in ADLs. Architectural factors in the home and walking ability limitations seem to be important predictors, suggesting that health care interventions should target home adaptations and mobility skills as a means to preventing or decreasing homebound status.

The area under the curve for time 0-24 hours/minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) pharmacodynamic ratio has shown the best correlation with the efficacy of tedizolid, versus the time above MIC ratio and the maximum drug concentration/ minimum inhibitory concentration ratio. Administration of this antibiotic for 6 days has shown its noninferiority versus administration of linezolid for 10 days in patients with skin and skin structure infections enrolled in two Phase III studies (ESTABLISH-1 and ESTABLISH-2). Tedizolid's more favorable safety profile and dosage regimen, which allow once-daily administration, versus linezolid, position it as a good therapeutic alternative. However, whether or not the greater economic cost associated with this antibiotic is offset by its shorter treatment duration and possibility of oral administration in routine clinical practice has yet to be clarified.

Although long periods are needed to detect changes in species composition, the responses of perennial plants may be visible in the short term. The ability of plants to tolerate herbivory may be influenced by the availability of resources and nearby vegetation. The aim of this study is to assess the effect of proximity to other plants on the response of adult plants to livestock exclusion. After 3 years of exclusion, we quantify the differences in size (height and canopy size) and reproductive organ production in eight predominant shrubs species. We consider three neighborhood conditions: Alone, Partially or Completely covered. Our results showed that palatable species present larger sizes inside the exclusion areas. Neighborhood influence depended on the studied species. The density of reproductive organs decreased with exclusion for four species, and proximity to neighboring plants had different effects depending on the species. The species that showed greater size inside the exclusion areas when they were Partially and/or Completely covered by other plants and did not show the same pattern for reproductive organ production, which indicated a possible process of light competition. Four of the eight species presented greater size and/or density of reproductive organs on Alone plants, especially inside the exclusion areas, which suggested that herbivore exclusion can intensify competition among plants. The present study showed that the effect of the exclusion of livestock grazing was affected by plant-plant interactions, which may affect the changes in the composition of the plant community found after permanent removal of livestock.

Methanogenic activity of accumulated solids and gas emissions from planted and unplanted shallow horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Subsurface flow constructed wetlands; Wetland depth; Plant species; Methane; Carbon dioxide; Greenhouse gases	URBAN WASTE-WATER; NITROGEN; METHANE; HYDROLYSIS; EFFICIENCY; BIOMASS; DESIGNS; CARBON; TESTS; MARSH	Anaerobic processes play an important role in horizontal subsurface flow (HSSF) constructed wetlands (CW) and methane generation contributes to overall greenhouse gas emissions. Plants and bed depth are two main factors that can influence anaerobic processes but the effect of plants' presence and species on methane emissions on shallower HSSF (0.3 m bed depth) has not been studied. We measured CH4 and CO2 emissions from a pilot plant constituted of five HSSF units in parallel with different plant species (CW1-UN: unplanted, CW2-JE: Juncus effusus, ON3-IP: Iris pseudacorus, CW4-TL: Typha latifoha L. and CW5-PA: Phragmites australis). Shallow HSSF beds showed high methane emissions (averaging 440 mgCH4/m2=d) even at low loading rates (<5.0 gBOD(5)/m(2)*d). Differences in mean emissions between units were not significant. However, the unplanted unit showed lower methane emissions during cold periods and higher emissions during warmer periods than planted units. Temperature was the main variable determining CO2 and CH4 emission for all units, except for CO2 emissions in CW2-JE unit. Temperature models explained 63-98% of seasonal variability and predicted zero emissions of CH4 and CO2 at temperatures of 9 +/- 1 degrees C and 7.6 +/- 1.3 degrees C, respectively. Organic matter accumulation (volatile solids, VS), specific methanogenic activity (SMA) and methane potential (MP) of accumulated solids were also determined. None of these parameters showed significant differences among CW units, except the higher values of MP in CW2-JE unit. While VS content and minimum SMA clearly increased with operation time, maximum SMA and MP remained stable. Potential methane emissions can be estimated from the product of surface density of VS and SMA, the measured emissions fitting well in the estimated range from batch assays. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Sedimentation and resuspension modelling in free water surface constructed wetlands	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	6th International Symposium on Wetland Pollutant Dynamics and Control (WETPOL) / Annual Conference of the Constructed-Wetlands-Association (CWA)	SEP 13-18, 2015	York, ENGLAND	Cranfield Univ, Constructed Wetlands Assoc		Suspended solids; Phosphorus; Phytoplankton; Modelling; Constructed wetland; Avifauna	PHOSPHORUS DYNAMICS; MATHEMATICAL-MODEL; ECOSYSTEM MODEL; LAKE; MARSH; WIND; SIMULATION; VALENCIA; NITROGEN; REMOVAL	Eutrophication is a widespread problem that is being tackled from many perspectives and the recently applied technology of constructed wetlands is being used in the treatment of eutrophic water. However, process-based models to simulate their performance are scarce, so in this work a mechanistic model was developed to simulate the removal of total suspended solids, phytoplankton and total phosphorus in free water surface constructed wetlands treating eutrophic water. The model represents the influence of the main factors of the biotope and biota on these water quality variables, and particular attention is paid to resuspension produced by wind and by avifauna. Likewise, the effect of emergent vegetation cover in sedimentation, resuspension and phytoplankton growth is included. Phytoplankton is considered to store phosphorus internally in order to use it when growing, and the contribution of phytoplankton concentration to the suspended solids budget is included. The software AQUASIM was used to calibrate and validate the model in two full-scale constructed wetlands treating eutrophic water from Lake l'Albufera de Valencia (Spain) for three years. The simulated data and field measurements showed satisfactory adjustments for the three studied variables. The budgets obtained for each variable reveal that sedimentation and resuspension are the main processes in total suspended solids performance. Sedimentation of organic particulate phosphorus is the most important process in total phosphorus removal. The sum of the effect of resuspension by avifauna and by wind increases by more than 50% the quantity of solids that enters the water column.

Relatively little is known of winter ecology in these systems, due to a historical research focus on summer 'growing seasons'. We executed the first global quantitative synthesis on under-ice lake ecology, including 36 abiotic and biotic variables from 42 research groups and 101 lakes, examining seasonal differences and connections as well as how seasonal differences vary with geophysical factors. Plankton were more abundant under ice than expected; mean winter values were 43.2% of summer values for chlorophyll a, 15.8% of summer phytoplankton biovolume and 25.3% of summer zooplankton density. Dissolved nitrogen concentrations were typically higher during winter, and these differences were exaggerated in smaller lakes. Lake size also influenced winter-summer patterns for dissolved organic carbon (DOC), with higher winter DOC in smaller lakes. At coarse levels of taxonomic aggregation, phytoplankton and zooplankton community composition showed few systematic differences between seasons, although literature suggests that seasonal differences are frequently lake-specific, species-specific, or occur at the level of functional group. Within the subset of lakes that had longer time series, winter influenced the subsequent summer for some nutrient variables and zooplankton biomass.

Current status of the brown trout (Salmo trutta) populations within eastern Pyrenees genetic refuges	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH			English	Article						brown trout; conservation; stocking impact; genetic refuges; management	DENSITY-DEPENDENT MORTALITY; MEDITERRANEAN STREAMS; RAINBOW-TROUT; BROOK TROUT; CONSERVATION; FISH; WILD; INTROGRESSION; HYBRIDIZATION; HYBRIDS	Since the end of the 20th century, some headwaters of rivers in the eastern Pyrenees have been designated as genetic refuges to protect remaining native brown trout (Salmo trutta) diversity. The declaration was based on limited or no evidence of genetic impact from released non-native Atlantic hatchery fish. Hatchery releases were completely banned into the genetic refuges, but pre-existing fishing activities were maintained. Specific locations in each refuge have been monitored every 2-3 trout generations to update genetic information to accurately assess the contribution of these reservoirs to the preservation of native brown trout gene pools. This work updates genetic information to year 2014 in three of these locations (in Ter, Freser and Flamisell rivers). Previous studies identified hatchery introgressed populations within refuges and suggested discrepancies between the underlying intention of the genetic refuges and the gene pools detected. Therefore, we also examined genetic divergences among locations inside refuge river segments. Combined information at five microsatellite and the lactate dehydrogenase C (LDH-C*) loci showed reduced but significant temporal native allele frequency fluctuations in some of the above specific locations that did not modify overall levels of local diversity and river divergences. Bayesian clustering analyses confirmed the presence of differentiated native units within each genetic refuge. Some locations of the Freser River within the genetic refuge area showed high hatchery impact of non-native fish (over 20%). We discuss additional local actions (releases of native fish, selective removals and fishery reinforcement with sterile individuals) to improve the conservation objective of genetic refuges.

Habitat selection and maternal care are expected to provide shelter for eggs against scouring and predators. However, females also tend to produce variable egg sizes, and this trait may interact with habitat quality to influence the survival of offspring. In this study, we aimed at evaluating the role of female habitat selection on egg survival conditional on individual egg size and female body size. We monitored female reproductive activity in two natural rivers for 3 years, in order to relate nest characteristics to female body size. Bigger females dug deeper nests at lower shear stress force. Right after the end of nest construction, we sampled a part of the eggs laid by each female, measured them individually, and placed them back using capsules within their original position in the nest. At time of hatching, the capsules within the nest were collected and individual egg mortality was assessed. Our results indicate that scouring was the main driver for mortality (75%) and that nest burial depth and shear stress force above the nest both influenced scouring. However, subsequent survival was influenced by neither nest characteristics, individual egg size, nor the interaction between both. It is therefore expected that traits or tactics that reduce nest scouring probability should be under strong selection.

The empirical results provide significant evidence of both short-run and long-run asymmetries in the linkage between ten industry CDS spreads and the potential driving factors common for all industries, confirming the importance of asymmetric nonlinearity in this context. It is also shown that the industry equity prices, the VIX, the 5-year Treasury bond rate and, to a lesser extent, the crude oil price constitute important asymmetric determinants of these U.S. industry CDS spreads. The findings of this study have relevant implications for investors, speculators, arbitrageurs and policy makers interested in credit risk at the industry level.

We use panel data cointegration methods and control for spatial externalities linked to human and social capital. Our empirical results, robust to different specifications and additional control variables, show a significant direct effect of public R &D capital on productivity. No significant results are observed for private R & D capital. In contrast, the effect of patents is highly significant but proves to be small. Furthermore, Spain has greatly benefited from importing technology from leading countries. Spatial spillovers are crucial in explaining long-run productivity for the case of Spain. Human and social capital exert direct positive impacts, however, their effects are geographically bounded and negative spatial spillovers offset direct outcomes. Overall TFP increases when neighbouring territories engage in R & D activities.

The fact that these kinds of energies are intermittent can be overcome with using energy storage systems. Wind energy coupled with compressed air energy storage systems is one of the best candidates in this respect. The main objective of this paper is to study the integration of this system with a Combined Cooling, Heating and Power cycle comprised of a gas turbine, an organic Rankine cycle and an absorption refrigeration system. Energy and exergy analyses are applied to the system and the effect of key parameters on the system performance are analyzed. The results show that under design condition, the system can generate 33.67 kW electricity, 2.56 kW cooling and 1.82 ton per day hot water with a round trip energy efficiency of 53.94%. Also exergy analysis reveals that wind turbine, combustion chamber and compress air storage system have the highest amount of exergy destruction respectively. Finally, sensitivity analysis shows that parameters related to gas turbine are the most prominent. parameters of the system which can change performance of the system considerably.

Few researches have been conducted to date on the production of biodiesel from tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) seed oil. The aim of this study was to optimize the biodiesel production from this crude oil by non catalytic supercritical methanolysis using response surface methodology (RSM). Triglyceride conversion, total and individual FAME yield, monoglyceride and diglyceride yield, and thermal decomposition degree of biodiesel were determined in the temperature and reaction time ranges of 250-350 degrees C (12-43 MPa) and 15-90 min, respectively, at a fixed methanol-to-oil molar ratio of 43:1. According to the RSM, the optimal conditions were 303.4 degrees C and 90 min, reaching a predicted maximum FAME yield of 91.1 +/- 3.2 mol%. This maximum was very close to that obtained experimentally (92.8 +/- 2.1 mol%) at 300 degrees C and 90 min. Decomposition of biodiesel became evident at 325 degrees C and 60 min of reaction due to the thermal instability of unsaturated methyl esters (methyl linoleate and oleate). The biodiesel obtained in the best experimental reaction conditions (300 degrees C and 90 min), where no thermal decomposition of FAMEs was observed, contained most of the byproduct glycerol generated, which was degraded and incorporated to the product. This biodiesel basically failed to meet the content of FAMEs as required by the standard EN 14214, the content of monoglycerides and total glycerol, and the acid value, being a little above the required upper limits. However, this biodiesel can be blended with other biodiesels of complementary features to produce a biofuel meeting the requirements of the standard EN 14214. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Spot and long-term measurements were made with a dosimeter. The spot measurement mean was 1.51 +/- 0.48 V/m. Higher values were found in the proximity to the window and to the incubator evaluated. Mean field strength for the entire period of 17 h was 0.81 (+/- 0.07) V/m and the maximum value was 1.58 V/m for long-term RF-EMF measurements in the incubator. Values found during the night period were higher than those found during the day period. It is important to consider RF-EMF exposure levels in neonatal care units, due to some evidence of adverse health effects found in children and adults. Characterization of RF-EMF exposure may be important to further investigate the mechanisms and underlying effects of electromagnetic fields (EMF) on infant health. A prudent avoidance strategy should be adopted because newborns are at a vulnerable stage of development and the actual impact of EMF on premature infants is unknown.	[Calvente, I.; Fernandez, M.

J	Carmona, R; Linares, C; Ortiz, C; Vazquez, B; Diaz, J				Carmona, Rocio; Linares, Cristina; Ortiz, Cristina; Vazquez, Blanca; Diaz, Julio			Effects of noise on telephone calls to the Madrid Regional Medical Emergency Service (SUMMA 112)	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Road traffic noise; Emergencies; Emergency ambulance dispatches; Time series	ROAD TRAFFIC NOISE; TIME-SERIES-ANALYSIS; WAVE PREVENTION PLAN; CORONARY-HEART-DISEASE; SHORT-TERM EXPOSURE; AIR-POLLUTION; AMBULANCE DISPATCHES; CASE-CROSSOVER; GEOGRAPHICAL VARIATION; ENVIRONMENTAL NOISE	Background: Although the effects of noise on population morbidity and mortality have been observed both in the short and long term, the morbidity and mortality indicators used to date have not enabled information on such health effects to be accessed in real time. At an international level, there are relatively few studies, mostly recent, which have considered an alternative indicator, such as the demand for medical attention provided by emergency services, taking into account environmental factors other than noise. Objectives: To ascertain the short-term effect of road-traffic noise levels on medical care, broken down by organic, circulatory and respiratory causes, provided by the Madrid Regional Medical Emergency Service (Servicio de Urgencia Medica de Madrid/SUMMA 112). Methods: We used an ecological time-series study and fitted Poisson regression models, to analyse the number of daily, cause-specific episodes of care provided in situ by SUMMA 112, via emergency ambulance dispatches, across the period 01/01/2008-31/12/2009. To this end, we considered diurnal (Leqd: 7-23 h), nocturnal (Leqn: 23-7 h) and daily (Leq24: 24 h) noise (in db(A)) as the principal factor, and chemical air pollution (mu g/m(3)) and temperature (degrees C) as the control variables. We also controlled for trend and seasonalities, the autoregressive nature of the series, and day of the week. Results: Nocturnal noise exceeded the WHO threshold (55 db(A)) on 100% of nights, despite displaying a downward trend across the study period. For all causes, with the exception of emergency calls due to ischaemic disease, it was nocturnal rather than diurnal noise levels that had a short-term effect (lags 0-1) on SUMMA 112 calls, with this impact being greater for respiratory than for circulatory causes. Hence, for every increase of 1db in Leqn, the relative risks (RRs) were as follows: 1.11 (95% CI 1.09-1.13) for organic causes; 1.14 (95% CI: 1.11-1.18) for respiratory causes; and 1.08 (95% CI: 1.05-1.10) for circulatory causes. Conclusion: SUMMA 112 data give access to real-time information on the health effects associated with increases in noise levels, which cannot be obtained via mortality or hospital-admission data, since these are collected in the longer term. Accordingly, this is something that would be immediately applicable in any future implementation of a syndromic surveillance system focusing on the effects of environmental pollutants on health.

Two species, spinach (Spinacia oleracea) and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.), were grown in field soil amended with a single application of biosolids (at agronomic rate for nitrogen), to represent the scenario using commercial biosolids as fertilizer, and the third crop, corn (Zea mays) was grown in spiked soil (similar to 50 mg PFOS/kg soil, similar to 5 mg Deca-BDE/kg soil and a mixture of both, similar to 50 mg PFOS and similar to 5 mg Deca-BDE/kg soil) to represent a worst-case scenario. To examine the bioaccumulation in soil invertebrates, earthworms (Eisenia andrei) were exposed to the spiked soil where corn had been grown. PFASs and HFRs were detected in the three crops and earthworms. To evaluate the distribution of the compounds in the different plant tissues, transfer factors (TFs) were calculated, with TF values higher for PFASs than PBDEs in all crop plants: from 2 to 9-fold in spinach, 2 to 34-fold in tomato and 11 to 309-fold in corn. Bioaccumulation factor (BAF) values in earthworms were also higher for PFASs (4.06 +/- 2.23) than PBDEs (0.02 +/- 0.02).

Short-term association between environmental factors and hospital admissions due to dementia in Madrid	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Road traffic noise; Air pollution; Heat waves; Dementia; Hospital admissions; Time series	TIME-SERIES-ANALYSIS; AIR-POLLUTION; TRAFFIC NOISE; HEAT-WAVE; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; DAILY MORTALITY; SPAIN; STRESS; ADULTS; MORBIDITY	Background: Spain has one of the highest proportions of dementia in the world among the population aged 60 years or over. Recent studies link various environmental factors to neurocognitive-type diseases. This study sought to analyse whether urban risk factors such as traffic noise, pollutants and heat waves might have a short-term impact on exacerbation of symptoms of dementia, leading to emergency hospital admission. Material and methods: We conducted a longitudinal ecological time-series study, with the dependent variable being the number of daily dementia-related emergency (DDE) hospital admissions to Madrid municipal hospitals (ICD-10 codes 290.0-290.2, 290.4-290.9, 294.1-294) from 01 to 01-2001 to 31-12-2009, as obtained from the Hospital Morbidity Survey (National Statistics Institute). The measures used were as follows: for noise pollution, Leqd, equivalent diurnal noise level (from 8 to 22 h), and Leqn, equivalent nocturnal noise level (from 22 to 8 h) in dB(A); for chemical pollution, mean daily NO2, PM2.5, PM1 as provided by the Madrid Municipal Air Quality Monitoring Grid; and lastly, maximum daily temperature (degrees C), as supplied by the State Meteorological Agency. Scatterplot diagrams were plotted to assess the type of functional relationship existing between the main variable of analysis and the environmental variables. The lags of the environmental variables were calculated to analyse the timing of the effect. Poisson regression models were fitted, controlling for trends and seasonalities, to quantify relative risk (RR). Results: During the study period, there were 1175 DDE hospital admissions. These admissions displayed a linear functional relationship without a threshold in the case of Leqd. The RR of DDE admissions was 1.15 (1.11-1.20) for an increase of 1 dB in Leqd, with impact at lag 0. In the case of maximum daily temperature, there was a threshold temperature of 34 degrees C, with an increase of 1 degrees C over this threshold posing an RR of 1.19 (1.09-1.30) at lag 1. The only pollutant to show an association with DDE hospital admissions was 03 at lag 5, with an RR of 1.09 (1.04-1.15) for an increase of 10 mu g/m(3) Conclusions: Diurnal traffic noise, heat waves and tropospheric ozone may exacerbate the symptoms of dementia to the point of requiring emergency admission to hospital. Lowering exposure levels to these environmental factors could reduce dementia-related admissions in Madrid.

Green spaces and spectacles use in schoolchildren in Barcelona	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Eyeglasses; Natural environment; Myopia; Refractive errors; Ophthalmology; Urban environment; Built environment	TIME SPENT OUTDOORS; RISK-FACTORS; REFRACTIVE ERRORS; SURROUNDING GREENNESS; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; SCHOOL-CHILDREN; INCIDENT MYOPIA; AIR-POLLUTION; VISUAL-ACUITY; PREVALENCE	Myopia is one of the major causes of low visual acuity during childhood, and hence of the need for spectacles. It is generally more prevalent in urban areas where children are often less exposed to green spaces than in rural areas. This study evaluated the association between exposure to green space and use of spectacles (as a surrogate measure for myopia) in a cohort of 2727 schoolchildren (7-10 years old) recruited from 39 primary schools in Barcelona (2012-2015). We assessed exposure to green spaces by characterizing outdoor surrounding greenness at home and school and during commuting using satellite data on greenness (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index). We also obtained data on the annual average time children spent playing in green spaces through questionnaires. Cross-sectional analyses were conducted based on prevalent cases of spectacles use at baseline data collection campaign and longitudinal analyses based on incident cases of spectacles use during the three-year period between the baseline and last data collection campaigns. An interquartile range (IQR) increase in exposure to green space at home (500 m buffer) and school and during commuting was associated with respectively 14% (95% CI: 2%, 26%), 27% (95% CI: 6%, 44%), and 20% (95% CI: 5%, 33%) decrease in spectacles use in cross-sectional analyses. In longitudinal analyses, we observed a reduction of 23% (95% CI: 4%, 39%) and 34% (95% CI: 2%, 55%) associated with an IQR increase in greenness at home and school, respectively. Moreover, an IQR increase in time playing in green spaces was associated with a 28% (95% CI: 7%, 45%) reduction in the risk of spectacles use in the longitudinal analysis. Our observed reduced risk of spectacles use associated with higher contact with green space calls for more refined studies of the association between green spaces and refractive errors of visions.

Total oxidants in air and chlorine species in water were assessed by standard methods. All swimmers completed a questionnaire on health complaints. Exhaled breath condensate (EBC) was used to monitor the levels of leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and cysteinyl leukotrienes (CysLTs) in airway from competitive swimmers. Results: The new system resulted in a 75% and 39% reduction in the concentration of total oxidants and of nitrogen trichloride respectively in the air of the swimming pool. With the new system recreational swimmers experienced fewer symptoms of cough and irritation of the eyes, nose and skin. A decrease in eye irritation symptoms was also noted by competitive swimmers. The baseline concentration of CysLTs in EBC decreased significantly in Phase B with respect to Phase A. Conclusions: The new method markedly reduced the levels of irritant oxidant substances in the pool atmosphere that resulted in a reduction of eye, nose, skin and cough complaints in recreational swimmers, and eye irritation in competitive swimmers. It was also associated with reduced CysLT levels in the airways of competitive swimmers.

In addition, MeHg accumulation in the human body was estimated by a one-compartment model using three different patterns of MeHg exposure. In the adult male rat experiment, doses of 0.3 and 1.5 mg MeHg/kg/day were orally administered to the stable groups for 5 weeks, while 7-fold higher doses of 2.1 and 10.5 mg MeHg/kg/once a week were administered to the bolus groups. The blood Hg levels increased constantly in the stable groups, but increased with repeated waves in the bolus groups. At completion of the experiment, there were no significant differences in the brain Hg concentrations or neurological alterations between the stable and bolus groups, when the total doses of MeHg were the same. In the pregnant female rat experiment, a dose of 1 mg MeHg/kg/day was administered orally to the stable group for 20 days (until 1 day before expected parturition), while a 5-fold higher dose of 5 mg MeHg/kg/once every 5 days was administered to the bolus group. In the brains of the maternal/fetal rats, there were no significant differences in the Hg concentrations and neurological alterations between the stable and bolus groups. The mean Hg concentrations in the fetal brains were approximately 2-fold higher than those in the maternal brains for both stable and bolus groups. Using the one-compartment model, the Hg accumulation curves in humans at doses of 7 mu g MeHg/day, 48 mu g MeHg/once a week, and 96 mu g MeHg/once every 2 weeks were estimated to be similar, while the bolus groups showed dose-dependent amplitudes of repeated waves. These results suggest that stable and episodic/bolus patterns of MeHg exposure do not cause differences in Hg accumulation in the blood and brain, or in neurological alterations, when the total doses are the same.

Is gastrointestinal microbiota relevant for endogenous mercury methylation in terrestrial animals?	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Mercury; Methylation; Microbiota; Digestive tract; Terrestrial food chain	SULFATE-REDUCING BACTERIA; TERMITE MASTOTERMES-DARWINIENSIS; PORCELLIO-SCABER CRUSTACEA; IN-VITRO; ANAEROBIC-BACTERIA; INORGANIC MERCURY; HUMAN FECES; SP-NOV; GUT; METHYLMERCURY	The active role of gastrointestinal microbiota in mercury (Hg) methylation has been investigated in different terrestrial organisms from insects or annelids to rats and mammals, including the human beings. Some findings reveal the animal digestive tracts as new potential niches for Hg methylation especially in terrestrial invertebrates. However, contradictory results have been reported so far and there is still a long way to fully understand how important the MeHg production in this habitat could be, as well as its implications on the toxicity and biomagnification of MeHg within terrestrial food chains. It is important to know what has been studied in the past and discuss the previous results according to the new perspectives opened in this field. Therefore, the aim of this work is to review the present state of knowledge about the potential capability of gastrointestinal microbiota in Hg methylation with special emphasis in terrestrial animals and to propose new approaches profiting the new and powerful molecular and analytical tools.

Over the years, we have created large, mostly grey cities with many high-rise buildings and little green space. Disease rates tend to be higher in urban areas than in rural areas. More green space in cities could reduce these rates. Here, we describe the importance of green space for health, and make recommendations for further research. Green space has been associated with many beneficial health effects, including reduced all-cause and cardiovascular mortality and improved mental health, possibly through mediators, such as reduced air pollution, temperature and stress, and increased physical activity, social contacts, and restoration. Additional studies are needed to strengthen the evidence base and provide further guidelines to transport planners, urban planners, and landscape architects. We need more longitudinal studies and intervention studies, further understanding of the contribution of various mechanisms toward health, and more information on susceptible populations and on where, when, how much, and what type of green space is needed. Also needed are standardized methods for green space quality assessments and evaluations of effectiveness of green prescriptions in clinical practice. Many questions are ideally suited for environmental epidemiologists, who should work with other stakeholders to address the right questions and translate knowledge into action. In conclusion, a growing evidence base supports the hypothesis that greener cities are healthier cities.

This variation conveys information on adaptation, but ability to characterize is limited by the absence of a method to describe uncertainty in estimated minimum mortality temperatures. Methods: We propose an approximate parametric bootstrap estimator of confidence interval (CI) and standard error (SE) for the minimum mortality temperature from a temperature-mortality shape estimated by splines. Results: The coverage of the estimated CIs was close to nominal value (95%) in the datasets simulated, although SEs were slightly high. Applying the method to 52 Spanish provincial capital cities showed larger minimum mortality temperatures in hotter cities, rising almost exactly at the same rate as annual mean temperature. Conclusions: The method proposed for computing CIs and SEs for minimums from spline curves allows comparing minimum mortality temperatures in different cities and investigating their associations with climate properly, allowing for estimation uncertainty.

In colorectal cancer, the target population is the group aged 50-69 years, who are offered biennial testing using the faecal occult blood test in all programmes, with follow-up colonoscopy if the faecal occult blood test is positive. This article presents the main trends, indicators and differences by sex. The main indicators from 2006 to 2011 were analysed: coverage, participation rate, positivity rate, colonoscopy uptake and lesions detected. Annual trends were adjusted by sex and region. In 2011, coverage was 9.74% of the Spanish target population. A total of 1 001 669 first invitations were registered from 2006 to 2011 and 596 649 individuals participated in the programmes (43.83% participation rate). Results were positive in 30 544 individuals (5.47%), with the lowest positivity rate occurring in 2007 (3.06%) and the highest in 2011 (6.30%) (P < 0.001). In all, 27 568 colonoscopies were registered, with a high compliance rate (90.00% in 2011 and 95.59% in 2007) (P = 0.381). The adenoma and colorectal cancer detection rates increased over the period, reaching 32.25/1000 and 3.42/1000 participants in 2011, respectively (P < 0.001 and P = 0.001). Comparison of differences by sex showed that detection rates were significantly higher in men than in women (P < 0.001). Participation increased over time and has now reached an acceptable rate. Men show low participation but higher detection rates, indicating the need for further intervention. The Spanish Cancer Screening Network provides common evaluation, performance and organizational benchmarking. Copyright (C) 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.

In the Autonomous Community of Madrid, an online questionnaire on cancer prevention was sent to a random sample of primary care professionals (3586 FP and nurses). The data included sex, age, profession, years in primary care, specific postgraduate training, and opinions and attitudes toward cancer prevention. A descriptive analysis was carried out. Factors associated with a low/null self-perceived influence on early detection of breast cancer were analyzed separately for FP and nurses with multivariate logistic regression models. In all, 76.4% of the participants considered that their influence on the early detection of breast cancer was enough/high. FP attributed to themselves a higher influence than nurses (enough/high: 86.0 vs. 64.6%, P<0.01), and a lower perception was associated with a low/null perceived utility of their individual intervention [odds ratio (OR): 6.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.77-14.85]. Among nurses, also associated with this low/null perceived utility [adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 2.81, 95% CI 1.37-5.77] were the absence of postgraduate training in the matter (aOR: 2.56, 95% CI 1.05-6.25), and a low/null perception of feasibility of prevention programs in their centers (aOR: 1.93, 95% CI 1.25-2.98). Primary care professionals perceive their activity in the early detection of breast cancer as relevant, especially FP. To increase knowledge of the utility of individual interventions, specific training and improvement of the feasibility of these programs could enhance this perception.

In this paper we take a more general path. This path furnishes proof that (in such systems) indeterminism based on deterministic collisions is rather more common than is suggested in studies published to date. A detailed analysis is made of what are known as inflationary scenarios, an interesting type of very general situations that display indeterminism.

The theory allows for a very appealing physical picture and for a relatively simple description of the main features of the instability. As a result, it is suitable for the study of the very complex problem of the instability of accelerated solids with non-linear elastic-plastic constitutive properties, which cannot be studied by the usual normal modes approach. The elastic to plastic transition occurring early in the instability process determines the entire evolution and makes the instability exhibit behavior that cannot be captured by an asymptotic analysis.

OLIVE YIELDS FORECASTS AND OIL PRICE TRENDS IN MEDITERRANEAN AREAS: A COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS OF THE LAST TWO DECADES	EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE			English	Article							OLEA-EUROPAEA L.; CROP YIELD; POLLEN; MODELS; INDEXES; PHASES; SERIES	The main objective of this research was to utilize pollen monitoring methodology to predict olive yields in three Mediterranean olive cultivation areas (Spain, Italy and Tunisia) and their relationships with the olive oil price dynamics. Moreover, olive yield and olive oil production compared with olive oil price trends in the last two decades was evaluated. The statistical analyses confirmed that biological parameters such as the pollen emission, the pollen season start (Pss), the full flowering (Ff) date or the pollen season length (Psl) showed positive correlation values with productive parameters, especially the Pollen Index (Pi). However, the difficulty to define clear relationships with oil price for optimizing the marketing strategies can be due to the olive sector European policy and to the complex international olive oil market situation. The occurrence of unharvested trees was increased and the reduction in agricultural operations as well as non-harvesting could become more widespread above all in traditional extensive systems.

Planktonic bacterial community dynamics over short timescales can be of great importance for food webs and ecosystem functioning but are rarely described when microbial community and composition are assessed. To study the significance of such dynamics we sampled the surface water at the deepest point of a mesotrophic lake (Lake Erken, Sweden) every third hour over two days. 2. By combining 454 pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes with bromodeoxyuridine immunocapturing of DNA, replicating populations were identified and compared to the community retrieved from total DNA samples. This comparison revealed a significant difference between the actively replicating and total community. 3. The high-frequency diurnal sampling was compared to a year-long survey conducted in the same lake in order to compare the diurnal and seasonal variation in bacterioplankton community composition. At the diurnal-scale, the variation was significantly higher in the replicating than in the total community. However, variation in both active and total diurnal community was significantly lower than the variation in the seasonal total community. 4. Our analysis revealed pronounced short-term dynamics of individual bacterial populations uncoupled from the diurnal light cycle. For example, the proliferating fraction of the most abundant bacterial tribe (LD12) followed a cyclic pattern that covaried with viral abundance. This implies that environmental factors other than light may act as important drivers of microbial community composition, at least in mesotrophic Lake Erken.

The South Armorican lavas consist of continental tholeiites in middle Cambrian-Furongian sequences related to continental break-up. A significant volcanic activity occurred in the Tremadocian, dominated by crustal melted rhyolitic lavas and initial rifting tholeiites. The Occitan lavas are distributed into five volcanic phases: (1) basal Cambrian rhyolites, (2) upper lower Cambrian Mg-rich tholeiites close to N-MORBs but crustal contaminated, (3) upper loweremiddle Cambrian continental tholeiites, (4) Tremadocian rhyolites, and (5) upper lower Ordovician initial rift tholeiites. A rifting event linked to asthenosphere upwelling took place in the late early Cambrian but did not evolve. It renewed in the Tremadocian with abundant crustal melting due to underplating of mixed asthenospheric and lithospheric magmas. This main tectono-magmatic continental rift is termed the "Tremadocian Tectonic Belt" underlined by a chain of rhyolitic volcanoes from Occitan and South Armorican domains to Central Iberia. It evolved with the setting of syn-rift coarse siliciclastic deposits overlain by post-rift deep water shales in a suite of sedimentary basins that forecasted the South ArmoricaneMedio-European Ocean as a part of the Palaeotethys Ocean.

Such changes occur as growth improves at the poleward edge of a species distribution and declines at the range edge in the opposite or equatorial direction, mirrored by changes in the establishment of new individuals. A substantial body of evidence demonstrates that such processes are underway for a wide variety of species. Case studies from populations at the equatorial range edge of a variety of woody species have led us to understand that widespread growth decline and distributional shifts are underway. However, in apparent contrast, other studies report high productivity and reproduction in some range edge populations. We sought to assess temporal trends in the growth of the widespread European beech tree (Fagus sylvatica) across its latitudinal range. We explored the stability of populations to major drought events and the implications for predicted widespread growth decline at its equatorial range edge. In contrast to expectations, we found greatest sensitivity and low resistance to drought in the core of the species range, whilst dry range edge populations showed particularly high resistance to drought and little evidence of drought-linked growth decline. We hypothesize that this high range edge resistance to drought is driven primarily by local environmental factors that allow relict populations to persist despite regionally unfavourable climate. The persistence of such populations demonstrates that range-edge decline is not ubiquitous and is likely to be driven by declining population density at the landscape scale rather than sudden and widespread range retraction.

Saline and saline-prone agricultural lands represent an opportunity for growing energy crops avoiding the displacement of food production and contributing to restoration of degraded land. Giant reed (Arundo donax L.) is a perennial grass that has been proposed as a promising energy crop for lignocellulosic biomass production while its tolerance to salinity has been proved. In this work, the identification of surplus saline lands that could be irrigated with saline waters for growing tolerant-energy crops (giant reed) in the mainland of Spain and the assessment of the agronomically attainable yield in these limiting growing conditions were undertaken. To this purpose, a GIS analysis was conducted using geo-databases related to saline areas, agro-climatic conditions, irrigation water requirements, agricultural land availability, restrictions regarding the range of electrical conductivity tolerated by the crop, competition with agro-food crops and irrigation water provisions. According to the approach developed, the irrigated and saline agricultural area available and suitable for biomass production from giant reed amounted up to 34 412 ha. The agronomically attainable yield in these limiting conditions was estimated at 12.7 - 22.2 t dm ha(-1) yr(-1) and the potential production of lignocellulosic biomass, 597 338 t dm yr(-1). The methodology followed in this study can be applied to other target regions; it allows the identification of this type of marginal lands, where salinity-tolerant plant species could be grown for bioenergy purposes, avoiding competition with agro-food crops, and where soil restoration measurements should be undertaken.

In particular, there has been recent controversy about possible latitudinal trends in compositional heterogeneity across localities (beta-diversity). A gradient in the size of the regional species pool alone can be expected to impose a parallel gradient on beta-diversity, but whether beta-diversity also varies independently of the size of the species pool remains unclear. A recently suggested methodological approach to correct latitudinal beta-diversity gradients for the species pool effect is based on randomization null models that remove the effects of gradients in alpha- and gamma-diversity on beta-diversity. However, the randomization process imposes constraints on the variability of alpha-diversity, which in turn force gamma- and beta-diversity to become interdependent, such that any change in one is mirrored in the other. We argue that simple null model approaches are inadequate to discern whether correlations between alpha-, beta- and gamma-diversity reflect processes of ecological interest or merely differences in the size of the species pool among localities. We demonstrate that this kind of Narcissus effect may also apply to other metrics of spatial or phylogenetic species distribution. We highlight that Narcissus effects may lead to artificially high rejection rates for the focal pattern (Type II errors) and caution that these errors have not received sufficient attention in the ecological literature.

Spatial and evolutionary parallelism between shade and drought tolerance explains the distributions of conifers in the conterminous United States	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY			English	Article						Conifers; National Forest Inventory; niche conservatism; phylogenetic correlations; southern North America; trait evolution; trait geographical patterns	PHYLOGENETIC NICHE CONSERVATISM; ADAPTIVE EVOLUTION; RANDOM FORESTS; TRADE-OFF; TRAITS; ECOLOGY; FIRE; SIGNAL; SCALE; ENVIRONMENTS	Aim Gymnosperms do not follow a latitudinal diversity gradient across the Northern Hemisphere but are influenced by geography at continental scales. Tolerance to physiological aridity is thought to be the main driver of this distribution, yet through evolutionary time conifers have also faced conditions of frost, shade and fire. We tested four predictions to evaluate how environmental stressors and geographical and evolutionary patterns of traits influence conifer distributions: (1) environmental variables related to aridity are most important in explaining geographical patterns of traits; (2) traits responsible for survival in stressful conditions have evolved under a niche conservatism constraint; (3) phylogenetic correlations among traits as the result of complex evolutionary responses to multiple abiotic stressors are widespread; (4) there are parallelisms between spatial trait associations and correlated trait evolution. Location The conterminous United States. Methods We combined conifer occurrences with 10 traits related to drought, freezing, shade and fire. The spatial distribution of traits was mapped and the relationship between environment and the geographical patterns of traits was explored. Niche conservatism was assessed comparing patterns of trait evolution against Brownian motion. We computed geographical and phylogenetic correlations among traits to determine the correspondence between spatial and evolutionary trade-offs. Results (1) Maximum temperature followed by precipitation were the environmental variables that best described the geographical distributions of traits. (2) Most traits contain a phylogenetic signal consistent with niche conservatism: major exceptions being fire-related traits and frost tolerance. (3) Drought and shade tolerances show one of the strongest negative phylogenetic correlations. (4) The drought-shade tolerance trade-off is mirrored at the biogeographical scale. Main conclusions Unlike in angiosperms, cold does not seem to have been a major driver in the evolutionary history of temperate conifers. A strong tradeoff between drought and shade tolerance is the simplest explanation for understanding the current distribution of conifers in North America.

The impact of increased exposure to UVB on planktonic primary producers and heterotrophs is uncertain. Here we test the null hypothesis that net community production (NCP) of plankton communities in surface waters of the tropical and subtropical ocean is not affected by ambient UVB radiation and extend this test to the global ocean, including the polar oceans and the Mediterranean Sea using previous results. Location We conducted experiments with 131 surface communities sampled during a circumnavigation cruise along the tropical and subtropical ocean and combined these results with 89 previous reports encompassing the Atlantic, Pacific, Arctic and Southern Oceans and the Mediterranean Sea. Methods The use of quartz (transparent to UVB radiation) and borosilicate glass materials (opaque to most UVB) for incubations allowed us to compare NCP between communities where UVB is excluded and those receiving natural UVB radiation. Results We found that NCP varies when exposed to natural UVB radiation compared to those where UVB was removed. NCP of autotrophic communities tended to decrease under natural UVB radiation, whereas the NCP of heterotrophic communities tended to increase. However, these variations showed the opposite trend under higher levels of UVB radiation. Main conclusions Our results suggest that earlier estimates of NCP for surface communities, which were hitherto derived using materials blocking UVB radiation were biased, with the direction and magnitude of this bias depending on the metabolic status of the communities and the underwater penetration of UVB radiation.

Relative to the classical diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) model, FWE is also expected to increase sensitivity to microstructural changes in longitudinal studies. However, it is not clear if these two models differ in their test-retest reproducibility. This study compares a bi-tensor model for FWE with DTI by extending a previous longitudinal-reproducibility 3T multisite study (10 sites, 7 different scanner models) of 50 healthy elderly participants (55-80 years old) scanned in two sessions at least 1 week apart. We computed the reproducibility of commonly used DTI metrics (FA: fractional anisotropy, MD: mean diffusivity, RD: radial diffusivity, and AXD: axial diffusivity), derived either using a DTI model or a FWE model. The DTI metrics were evaluated over 48 white-matter regions of the JHU-ICBM-DTI-81 white-matter labels atlas, and reproducibility errors were assessed. We found that relative to the DTI model, FWE significantly reduced reproducibility errors in most areas tested. In particular, for the FA and MD metrics, there was an average reduction of approximately 1% in the reproducibility error. The reproducibility scores did not significantly differ across sites. This study shows that FWE improves sensitivity and is thus promising for clinical applications, with the potential to identify more subtle changes. The increased reproducibility allows for smaller sample size or shorter trials in studies evaluating biomarkers of disease progression or treatment effects. Hum Brain Mapp 38:12-26, 2017.

However, changes in autumn phenology are well studied and their consistency across species, as well as their link with population trends, remains uncertain. We investigate changes in the autumn migration dates of 11 species of soaring birds over the Strait of Gibraltar over a 16-year period. Using models corrected for phylogeny, we assessed whether ecological and morphological characteristics, as well as population trends, account for interspecific shifts in migration times. We recorded different phenological changes in different periods of the migration season and suggest that these differences are due to age-dependent responses. The variable best predicting advances in migration dates was population trend: species that did not advance their autumn migration dates were those showing a decline in their European breeding populations. We repeated our tests on a dataset representing the migration date of soaring birds across the Pyrenees Mountains and found that population trends at this site also predicted phenological shifts. Our results suggest that flexibility in migratory strategy and population trends may be related, such that different adaptive capacity in migration timing may be more relevant than other ecological traits in determining the conservation status of migratory birds in Europe and perhaps other regions.

Unlike nesting species, an absence of the constraints resulting from raising offspring might also favour a flexible mating system that adjusts to changing ecological conditions. Information on brood parasites' mating systems and their spatio-temporal variation is, however, still scant. Here we analysed the genetic mating patterns of Great Spotted Cuckoos Clamator glandarius in two populations in northern and southern Spain and compared the results with those of previous studies. Parentage analyses showed high levels of polygamy in both populations that contrast with a prevalence of monogamy previously reported in the southern population. We suggest that the differences arise from an increase in population density, which in turn increases the probability of intraspecific encounters and therefore opportunities for mating. We also found that a greater number of mates increased the number of offspring produced, both in males and in females. The increase in offspring production in females might be the result of enhanced fertilization success during the lengthy laying period. Our data, combined with previous reports, demonstrate plasticity in the genetic mating patterns of the Great Spotted Cuckoo that may be associated with large fluctuations in population density.

These responses depend mainly on the relative size of the host compared with the parasitic egg. Small hosts must deal with an egg considerably larger than their own, so nest desertion becomes the only possible method of egg rejection in these cases. The use of artificial model eggs made of hard material in egg-recognition experiments has been criticized because hard eggs underestimate the frequency of egg ejection. However, no available studies have investigated the effect of softer material. Here, we test the potential effect of size of dummy parasitic eggs in relation to egg-rejection behaviour (egg ejection and nest desertion rates) in Western Bonelli's Warbler Phylloscopus bonelli, a small host, using plasticine non-mimetic eggs of three different sizes. In addition, we tested the potential effect of material, comparing ejection and desertion responses between real and plasticine eggs. As predicted, small eggs were always ejected, whereas nest desertion occurred more frequently with large eggs, thus suggesting that nest desertion occurs because of the constraints imposed by the large eggs. We found that plasticine may misrepresent the responses to experimental parasitism, at least in small host species, because this material facilitates egg ejection, provoking a decrease in nest desertion rate. Thus, particular caution is needed in the interpretation of the results in egg-rejection experiments performed using dummy eggs made of soft materials.

We examine nestling sex ratio in the Southern Grey Shrike Lanius meridionalis according to hatching order and clutch size. Southern Grey Shrike nestlings present a different sex ratio with body-mass rank order depending on clutch size. When the clutch size was five eggs (with a very low risk of brood reduction; 13%) the less costly sex (male) was found at the end of the body mass hierarchy. However, when clutch size was six eggs (with a high risk of brood reduction; 42%) the larger sex (female) was found at intermediate positions in the hatching order, possibly to decrease competitive asymmetries.

Extended State Observer-Based Sliding-Mode Control for Three-Phase Power Converters	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS			English	Article						Extended state observer (ESO); power factor correction; sliding-mode control (SMC); three-phase power converters	VARIABLE-STRUCTURE CONTROL; NONLINEAR-SYSTEMS; BOOST CONVERTER; DC CONVERTER; RECTIFIERS; ORDER	This paper proposes an extended state observer (ESO) based second-order sliding-mode (SOSM) control for three-phase two-level grid-connected power converters. The proposed control technique forces the input currents to track the desired values, which can indirectly regulate the output voltage while achieving a user-defined power factor. The presented approach has two control loops. A current control loop based on an SOSM and a dc-link voltage regulation loop which consists of an ESO plus SOSM. In this work, the load connected to the dc-link capacitor is considered as an external disturbance. An ESO is used to asymptotically reject this external disturbance. Therefore, its design is considered in the control law derivation to achieve a high performance. Theoretical analysis is given to show the closed-loop behavior of the proposed controller and experimental results are presented to validate the control algorithm under a real power converter prototype.

It reduces the performance of relays and contactors and is directly related to some of the processes that result in the destruction of the device. In this paper, a complete formulation of the problem is provided and a new strategy inspired by run-to-run control is presented for reducing contact bounce. The method, which makes use of the repetitive functioning of these systems, is highly versatile and may be applied to different switches under diverse operating conditions. In addition, it is able to deal with changes during the service life of the device, such as plastic deformations or the erosion of the contacts. Several experimental results are included to prove the effectiveness of the method.

This analysis is made using the tools of sliding mode controllers. The theory is developed considering that the thermal system can be described using diffusive representation. The experimental corroboration has been made with a prototype of a wind sensor for Mars atmosphere being controlled by a thermal sigma-delta modulator. This sensor structure allows to analyze the time-varying case experimentally since changes in wind conditions imply changes in the corresponding thermal models. The diffusive symbols of the experimental structures have been obtained from open-loop measurements in which pseudorandom binary sequences of heat are injected in the sensor. With the proposed approach, it is possible to predict heat flux transient waveforms in systems described by any arbitrary number of poles. This allows for the first time the analysis of lumped and distributed systems without any limitation on the number of poles describing it.

In this context, generating units with power electronics interfaces could offer as an additional service the active compensation for harmonic and interharmonic currents introduced by other converters or distorting loads. Typically, the converters of these generating units do not have information on the distortion of either other loads or of the grid current. Thus, this paper presents a control algorithm for grid harmonics and interharmonics compensation that relies only on the measurement of the voltage at the point of connection of the unit. The reference for the compensating current is calculated from the harmonic components of grid voltage in the synchronous reference frame. The paper also addresses the influence on the compensation performance of the line impedance between the generating unit and the point of connection. Experimental tests on a laboratory setup fully validate the proposed compensation method.

Daniel, 2013a). This program is based on Philosophy for Children (M. Lipman, A. M. Sharp, & F. S. Oscanyan, 1980) and aims to promote emotion knowledge, regulation strategies, and social competencies through peer-to-peer dialogue. Pre- and posttest measures were taken. Results showed low levels of initial knowledge and a clear pattern of improvement after the intervention.

As a consequence, patent analysts have to regularly view and examine a large amount of patents. This implies a very high workload. Interactive analysis aids that help to minimize this workload are thus of high demand. Still, these aids do not reduce the amount of the material to be examined, they only facilitate its examination. Its reduction can be achieved working with patent summaries instead of full patent documents. So far, high quality patent summaries are produced mainly manually and only a few research works address the problem of automatic patent summarization. Most often, these works either replicate the summarization metrics known from general discourse summarization or focus on the claims of a patent. However, it can be observed that neither of the strategies is adequate: general discourse state-of-the-art summarization techniques are of limited use due to the idiosyncrasies of the patent genre, and techniques that focus on claims only miss in their summaries important details provided in the other sections on the components of the invention introduced in the claims. We propose a patent summarization technique that takes the idiosyncrasies of the patent genre (such as the unbalanced distribution of the content across the different sections of a patent, excessive length of the sentences in the claims, abstract vocabulary, etc.) into account to obtain a comprehensive summary of the invention. In particular, we make use of lexical chains in the claims and in the description of the invention and of aligned claim-description segments at the sub-sentential level to assess the relevance of the individual fragments of the document for the summary. The most relevant fragments are selected and merged using full-fledged natural language generation techniques. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Evaluation of cytocompatibility of calcium silicate-based endodontic sealers and their effects on the biological responses of mesenchymal dental stem cells	INTERNATIONAL ENDODONTIC JOURNAL			English	Article						adhesion; calcium silicate-based endodontic sealers; cytotoxicity; mineral trioxide aggregate; periodontal ligament stem cells	ROOT REPAIR MATERIAL; HUMAN ORAL CELLS; IN-VITRO; CANAL SEALERS; MTA FILLAPEX; CYTOTOXICITY EVALUATION; PHYSICAL-PROPERTIES; BIOCOMPATIBILITY; BIOAGGREGATE; FIBROBLASTS	AimTo investigate invitro the cytocompatibility of the calcium silicate-containing endodontic sealers MTA Fillapex and TotalFill BC Sealer on human periodontal ligament stem cells (hPDLSCs) by assaying their biological responses and compare them with that observed when using an epoxy resin-based sealer (AH Plus). MethodologySpecimens from the three different endodontic sealers were eluated with culture medium for 24h. The cytotoxicity of these eluates was evaluated using the MTT assay. In addition, an invitro scratch wound healing model was used to determine their effects on cell migration. Cell adhesion to collagen type I after treatment with the different sealer eluates was also measured, whereas cytotoxicity was determined using the DNA-specific fluorochrome Hoechst 33342. Finally, to assess cell morphology and attachment to the different sealers, hPDLSCs were directly seeded onto the material surfaces and analysed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). One-way analysis of variance (anova) followed by a Bonferroni post-test were performed (P<0.05). ResultshPDLSCs exposed to different dilutions of TotalFill BC Sealer eluates had significantly higher cell proliferation compared with that observed when cells were treated with AH Plus and MTA Fillapex eluates (P<0.001). In addition, TotalFill eluates were associated with significantly increased cell adhesion to collagen type I and migration of hPDLSCs in a concentration-dependent manner than displayed after treatment with MTA Fillapex or AH Plus eluates (P<0.001). Moreover, TotalFill BC Sealer-induced cytotoxicity was significantly lower than observed using AH Plus and MTA Fillapex eluates (P<0.001). Finally, SEM studies revealed suitable proliferation, cell spreading and attachment, especially when using TotalFill BC Sealer discs. ConclusionTotalFill BC Sealer exhibited a higher cytocompatibility than AH Plus and MTA Fillapex. Further investigations using invivo animal models are required to validate the potential biological responses of TotalFill BC Sealer on hPDLSCs.	[Rodriguez-Lozano, F.

Efficacy of antimicrobial solutions against polymicrobial root canal biofilm	INTERNATIONAL ENDODONTIC JOURNAL			English	Article						alexidine; cetrimide; chlorhexidine; dentine; polymicrobial biofilm; sodium hypochlorite	ENTEROCOCCUS-FAECALIS BIOFILMS; IN-VITRO; CHLORHEXIDINE; IRRIGANTS; BACTERIA; DENTIN; ANTIBACTERIAL; CETRIMIDE; ALEXIDINE; SUSCEPTIBILITY	AimTo evaluate the antibiofilm activity of 2.5% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), 2% chlorhexidine (CHX), 2% alexidine (ALX) and 0.2% cetrimide (CTR) alone and in combination on mature polymicrobial root canal biofilms on human dentine using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). MethodologyTwenty-eight human dentine specimens were infected for 21days with microbial samples collected from infected root canals of three volunteers. Antibiofilm activity of the irrigating solutions was evaluated after 3min of contact time under CLSM. For quantification purposes, bioimage_L software was used. The variables evaluated were the log(10) of total biovolume (m(3)) and percentage of live cells (green) population. Statistical analysis of both variables was performed using an anova test and a post hoc Duncan test to determine significant clusters amongst groups. The variable green population percentage was previously subjected to the normalized Anscombe transformation. ResultsThe NaOCl group had a total biovolume and percentage of live cells significantly lower than the other groups (P?0.001). The addition of 0.2% CTR significantly increased the antimicrobial effect of 2% CHX (P?0.001). There were no significant differences between 0.2% CTR, 2% ALX and the combination of both (P?0.05). ConclusionsOverall, 2.5% NaOCl dissolved and killed bacteria significantly more efficiently when used against polymicrobial mature biofilm on human dentine. Cetrimide improved the antimicrobial activity of chlorhexidine and alexidine.

Comparative accuracy of the Clearing Technique, CBCT and Micro-CT methods in studying the mesial root canal configuration of mandibular first molars	INTERNATIONAL ENDODONTIC JOURNAL			English	Article						cone beam computed tomography; dental anatomy; mandibular molars; microcomputed tomography	BEAM COMPUTED-TOMOGRAPHY; CONE-BEAM; MICROCOMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY; PERMANENT MOLARS; HIGH-RESOLUTION; MAXILLARY 1ST; IN-VITRO; MORPHOLOGY; POPULATION; RADIOGRAPHY	AimsTo compare the accuracy of the clearing technique and cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) in the assessment of root canal configurations using micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) imaging system as the reference standard. MethodologyThirty-two mesial roots of mandibular first molars, selected on the basis of micro-CT scans (voxel size: 19.6m) and presenting several canal configurations, were evaluated using 2 CBCT scanners (voxels sizes: 120m and 150m) followed by the clearing technique. Two examiners analysed the data from each method and classified the anatomical configuration of the mesial canal according to Vertucci's system. Data were compared using Fisher's exact and chi-square tests. Reliability for each assessment was verified by the kappa test, and significance level was set at 5%. ResultsKappa value indicated a high level of agreement between the examiners. Detection of type I configurations was significantly lower in cleared teeth (P<0.05), whilst type II root canals were detected in all specimens by both tests (P>0.05). In mesial roots with variable anatomical configurations, CBCT and the clearing method were significantly less accurate than the reference standard (P<0.05). ConclusionWithin the tooth population studied, accuracy of identifying mesial root canal configuration was influenced greatly by the evaluation method and the type of anatomy. Detection of type I configurations in cleared teeth was significantly lower, whilst type II configurations were detected in all specimens by both methods. In mesial roots with variable anatomical configurations, neither CBCT nor clearing methods were accurate for detecting the actual root canal anatomy.	[Ordinola-Zapata, R.; Bramante, C.

Lichen biomarkers upon heating: a Raman spectroscopic study with implications for extra-terrestrial exploration	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ASTROBIOLOGY			English	Article						biomarkers; exobiology; lichen; Raman spectroscopy; thermal heating	INTERNATIONAL-SPACE-STATION; HOST ROCK COMPOSITION; LOW-EARTH-ORBIT; EPILITHIC MICROORGANISMS; LITHOPANSPERMIA THEORY; ANTARCTIC HABITATS; PLANETARY SURFACES; MARTIAN METEORITE; SHOCK EXPERIMENTS; SURVIVAL RATE	Lithopanspermia Theory has suggested that life was transferred among planets by meteorites and other rocky bodies. If the planet had an atmosphere, this transfer of life had to survive drastic temperature changes in a very short time in its entry or exit. Only organisms able to endure such a temperature range could colonize a planet from outer space. Many experiments are being carried out by NASA and European Space Agency to understand which organisms were able to survive and how. Among the suite of instruments designed for extraplanetary exploration, particularly for Mars surface exploration, a Raman spectrometer was selected with the main objective of looking for life signals. Among all attributes, Raman spectroscopy is able to identify organic and inorganic compounds, either pure or in admixture, without requiring sample manipulation. In this study, we used Raman spectroscopy to examine the lichen Squamarina lentigera biomarkers. We analyse spectral signature changes after sample heating under different experimental situations, such as (a) laser, (b) analysis accumulations over the same spot and (c) environmental temperature increase. Our goal is to evaluate the capability of Raman spectroscopy to identify unambiguously life markers even if heating has induced spectral changes, reflecting biomolecular transformations. Usnic acid, chlorophyll, carotene and calcium oxalates were identified by the Raman spectra. From our experiments, we have seen that usnic acid, carotene and calcium oxalates (the last two have been suggested to be good biomarkers) respond in a different way to environmental heating. Our main conclusion is that despite their abundance in nature or their inorganic composition the resistance to heat makes some molecules more suitable than others as biomarkers.

The use of multiple respiratory inhalers requiring different inhalation techniques has an adverse effect on COPD outcomes	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE			English	Article						chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; inhalation technique; exacerbations; inhaler devices; observational; matched cohort	OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY-DISEASE; DRY POWDER INHALER; ASTHMA PATIENTS; ADMIT SERIES; PRIMARY-CARE; ADHERENCE; THERAPY; DEVICES; ISSUES; ERRORS	Background: Patients with COPD may be prescribed multiple inhalers as part of their treatment regimen, which require different inhalation techniques. Previous literature has shown that the effectiveness of inhaled treatment can be adversely affected by incorrect inhaler technique. Prescribing a range of device types could worsen this problem, leading to poorer outcomes in COPD patients, but the impact is not yet known. Aims: To compare clinical outcomes of COPD patients who use devices requiring similar inhalation technique with those who use devices with mixed techniques. Methods: A matched cohort design was used, with 2 years of data from the Optimum Patient Care Research Database. Matching variables were established from a baseline year of follow-up data, and two cohorts were formed: a "similar-devices cohort" and a "mixed-devices cohort". COPD-related events were recorded during an outcome year of follow-up. The primary outcome measure was an incidence rate ratio (IRR) comparing the rate of exacerbations between study cohorts. A secondary outcome compared average daily use of short-acting beta agonist (SABA). Results: The final study sample contained 8,225 patients in each cohort (mean age 67 [SD, 10], 57% males, 37% current smokers). Patients in the similar-devices cohort had a lower rate of exacerbations compared with those in the mixed-devices cohort (adjusted IRR 0.82, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.80-0.84) and were less likely to be in a higher-dose SABA group (adjusted proportional odds ratio 0.54, 95% CI 0.51-0.57). Conclusion: COPD patients who were prescribed one or more additional inhaler devices requiring similar inhalation techniques to their previous device(s) showed better outcomes than those who were prescribed devices requiring different techniques.

A proof of concept implementation for anomaly detection from environmental data	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH			English	Article						Big data; real-time analysis; data streams; sensor networks; interoperability; brokering approach	CONTROL CHARTS; CUSUM; CLOUD; ARCHITECTURE; STANDARDS; PLATFORM	Pushed by the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm modern sensor networks monitor a wide range of phenomena, in areas such as environmental monitoring, health care, industrial processes, and smart cities. These networks provide a continuous pulse of the almost infinite activities that are happening in the physical space and are thus, key enablers for a Digital Earth Nervous System. Nevertheless, the rapid processing of these sensor data streams still continues to challenge traditional data-handling solutions and new approaches are being requested. We propose a generic answer to this challenge, which has the potential to support any form of distributed real-time analysis. This neutral methodology follows a brokering approach to work with different kinds of data sources and uses web-based standards to achieve interoperability.

However, the assumptions on which it is based make its application difficult in practical situations. In most companies, set-up and inventory costs are unknown, or may not even exist as such, although other data are known, such as available capacity in machining hours and limits set by the financing subsystem. The present work offers a multi-item inventory model that sets reference values using known values such as inventory investment limits and production capacity. In order to confer the proposed model's larger practical content, a spreadsheet available to be downloaded has been implemented. Finally, the model dynamics is illustrated as a numerical example obtained from a real company.

However, there are physical restrictions that can only be solved using software processing strategies. This is particularly true in the case of super resolution (SR) methodologies. SR techniques have found a fertile application field in airborne and space optical acquisition platforms. Single-frame SR methods may be advantageous for some remote-sensing platforms and acquisition time conditions. The contributions of this article are basically two: (1) to present an overview of single-frame SR methods, making a comparative analysis of their performance in different and challenging remote-sensing scenarios, and (2) to propose a new single-frame SR taxonomy, and a common validation strategy. Finally, we should emphasize that, on the one hand, this is the first time, to the best of our knowledge, that such a review and analysis of single SR methods is made in the framework of remote sensing, and, on the other hand, that the new single-frame SR taxonomy is aimed at shedding some light when classifying some types of single-frame SR methods.

Drawing on the global vector autoregression approach introduced in Pesaran, Schuermann, and Weiner, a multiregional spatial vector autoregressive (MultiREG-SpVAR) model is formulated and then applied to study the spatiotemporal transmission of macroeconomic shocks across the regions in Spain. The empirical application analyzes the extent to which a region's economic output growth is influenced by the growth of its neighbors (push-in or inward growth effect), and also investigates the relevance of spillovers derived from temporary region specific output growth shocks (push-out or outward growth effect). Our results identify some regions that perform as growth generators within the Spanish regional system since growth shocks from these regions spillover to a large number of regions of the country, playing a key role in the transmission of regional business cycles. The policy implications of our results suggest that national and/or regional governments should stimulate economic activity in these leading regions in order to enhance the economic recovery process of the whole Spanish economy.

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers are included in the current diagnostic criteria of Alzheimer's disease (AD) but their clinical utility is still unclear. Objective: We performed a systematic review of studies analyzing the diagnostic performance of CSF A beta(42), total tau (t-tau), and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) in the discrimination between AD and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) dementias. Methods: The following electronic databases were consulted until May 2016: Medline and PreMedline, EMBASE, PsycInfo, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, and CRD. For the first-time in the field, a Hierarchical Summary Receiver Operating Characteristic (HRSOC) model was applied, which avoids methodological problems of meta-analyses based on summary points of sensitivity and specificity values. We also investigated relevant confounders of CSF biomarkers' diagnostic performance such as age, disease duration, and global cognitive impairment. Results: The p-tau /A beta(42) ratio showed the best diagnostic performance. No statistically significant effects of the confounders were observed. Nonetheless, the p-tau /A beta(42) ratio may be especially indicated for younger patients. P-tau may be preferable for less cognitively impaired patients (high MMSE scores) and the t-tau /A beta(42) ratio for more cognitively impaired patients (low MMSE scores). Conclusion: The p-tau /A beta(42) ratio has potential for being implemented in the clinical routine for the differential diagnosis between AD and FTLD. It is of utmost importance that future studies report information on confounders such as age, disease duration, and cognitive impairment, which should also stimulate understanding of the role of these factors in disease mechanisms and pathophysiology.

Cerebrospinal Fluid A beta(42/40) Corresponds Better than A beta(42) to Amyloid PET in Alzheimer's Disease	JOURNAL OF ALZHEIMERS DISEASE			English	Article						Alzheimer's disease; amyloid-beta; biomarker; cerebrospinal fluid; positron emission tomography	MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; PITTSBURGH COMPOUND-B; A-BETA-42/A-BETA-40 RATIO; CSF A-BETA-42/A-BETA-40; BIOMARKER CHANGES; BETA; DEMENTIA; TAU; A-BETA-42; MARKERS	Background: Decreased concentrations of amyloid-beta 1-42 (A beta(42)) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and increased retention of A beta tracers in the brain on positron emission tomography (PET) are considered the earliest biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, a proportion of cases show discrepancies between the results of the two biomarker modalities which may reflect inter-individual differences in A beta metabolism. The CSF A beta(42/40) ratio seems to be a more accurate biomarker of clinical AD than CSF A beta(42) alone. Objective: We tested whether CSF A beta(42) alone or the A beta(42/40) ratio corresponds better with amyloid PET status and analyzed the distribution of cases with discordant CSF-PET results. Methods: CSF obtained from a mixed cohort (n = 200) of cognitively normal and abnormal research participants who had undergone amyloid PET within 12 months (n = 150 PET-negative, n = 50 PET-positive according to a previously published cut-off) was assayed for A beta(42) and A beta(40) using two recently developed immunoassays. Optimal CSF cut-offs for amyloid positivity were calculated, and concordance was tested by comparison of the areas under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves (AUC) and McNemar's test for paired proportions. Results: CSF A beta(42/40) corresponded better than A beta(42) with PET results, with a larger proportion of concordant cases (89.4% versus 74.9%, respectively, p < 0.0001) and a larger AUC (0.936 versus 0.814, respectively, p < 0.0001) associated with the ratio. For both CSF biomarkers, the percentage of CSF-abnormal/PET-normal cases was larger than that of CSF-normal/PET-abnormal cases. Conclusion: The CSF A beta(42/40) ratio is superior to A beta(42) alone as a marker of amyloid-positivity by PET. We hypothesize that this increase in performance reflects the ratio compensating for general between-individual variations in CSF total A beta.

Due to their direct implications in reproduction, the whole pelvis, particularly the os coxae, shows different characteristics in either sex. The sacrum and the os coxae constitute the birth canal. In this research study, the os coxae shape is analyzed using geometric morphometrics, providing information on morphology, regardless of size or any other factor beyond the geometry itself. A total of 46 adult ossa coxae from a Spanish archaeological collection were studied using geometric morphometrics. The results show that there is a restriction on the shape of female os coxae. In contrast, male os coxae presents a greater range of variation. The biological reason for this difference is the obstetrical dilemma; a concept defined as the anatomical conflict between bipedalism and the full-term birth of a neonate whose large head requires greater dimensions in the pelvic cavity. Our experimental data reinforce the validity of the obstetrical dilemma as source of the restriction on the shape of female ossa coxae. Additionally, according to the results obtained, size itself does not represent a condition for belonging to one sex or another.

Identification of the mechanisms enabling stable coexistence of species with similar resource requirements is a central challenge in ecology. Such coexistence can be facilitated by species at higher trophic levels through complex multi-trophic interactions, a mechanism that could be compromised by ongoing defaunation. 2. We investigated cascading effects of defaunation on Pachymerus cardo and Speciomerus giganteus, the specialized insect seed predators of the Neotropical palm Attalea butyracea, testing the hypothesis that vertebrate frugivores and granivores facilitate their coexistence. 3. Laboratory experiments showed that the two seed parasitoid species differed strongly in their reproductive ecology. Pachymerus produced many small eggs that it deposited exclusively on the fruit exocarp (exterior). Speciomerus produced few large eggs that it deposited exclusively on the endocarp, which is normally exposed only after a vertebrate handles the fruit. When eggs of the two species were deposited on the same fruit, Pachymerus triumphed only when it had a long head start, and the loser always succumbed to intraguild predation. 4. We collected field data on the fates of 6569 Attalea seeds across sites in central Panama with contrasting degrees of defaunation and wide variation in the abundance of vertebrate frugivores and granivores. Speciomerus dominated where vertebrate communities were intact, whereas Pachymerus dominated in defaunated sites. Variation in the relative abundance of Speciomerus across all 84 sampling sites was strongly positively related to the proportion of seeds attacked by rodents, an indicator of local vertebrate abundance. 5. Synthesis. We show that two species of insect seed predators relying on the same host plant species are niche differentiated in their reproductive strategies such that one species has the advantage when fruits are handled promptly by vertebrates and the other when they are not. Defaunation disrupts this mediating influence of vertebrates and strongly favours one species at the expense of the other, providing a case study of the cascading effects of defaunation and its potential to disrupt coexistence of non-target species, including the hyperdiverse phytophagous insects of tropical forests.

Similarity of ionic radii of strontium and divalent europium makes it an excellent host for Eu dopant. This paper reports on the Czochralski growth and spectroscopic study of SrB2O4 single crystals doped with europium and co-doped with europium and potassium. Based on recorded luminescence spectra it was found that both Eu3+ and Eu2+ ions occur in this host. Trivalent europium ions give rise to a narrow band long-lived red luminescence that is not affected by incorporation of potassium ions. Divalent europium ions emit a UV-blue luminescence, consisting of a large spectral band centered at ca 430 nm. In the absence of potassium ions the decay of this luminescence deviates slightly from a single exponential time dependence with a mean lifetime value of 2.0 ns. In potassium-co-doped sample a strong deviation from a single exponential decay was observed for longer stages of decay, beginning at ca 2.5 ns. This phenomenon was attributed to dissimilarity of relaxation rates of a fraction of europium ions distributed in different lattice sites that are distorted by the presence of big potassium ions. By co-doping the host with alkali ions one can influence the oxidation state of europium ions thereby enhancing the emission of trivalent europium ions. It was concluded that the material under study is a promising phosphor for visible light emission applications. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Garcia, C; Klein, EK; Jordano, P				Garcia, Cristina; Klein, Etienne K.; Jordano, Pedro			Dispersal processes driving plant movement: challenges for understanding and predicting range shifts in a changing world	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article						anthropocene; dispersal kernels; distribution range shifts; long-distance dispersal; migration	DISTANCE SEED DISPERSAL; CLIMATE-CHANGE; GENE FLOW; CONSEQUENCES; ENVIRONMENTS; ABSCISSION; DIVERSITY; EXTREMES; INVASION; TREES	1. Dispersal ecology is a broad topical discipline that tackles important conceptual and applied issues, such as the study of the ability of plants to transmit their propagules across fragmented and managed landscapes. 2. The relevance of dispersal for plant populations is threefold because: (i) dispersal processes scale from genes and individuals that disperse (or produce propagules to be dispersed) to population dynamics and both local and regional distribution patterns; (ii) by dispersing propagules or individuals and the genes they carry, dispersal inherently links demographic and genetic dynamics across the landscape; and (iii) dispersal elicits key ecological and evolutionary processes that sustain biodiversity, such as species assembly in species-rich communities. The steady improvement of tracking devices and molecular tools that trace the movement or infer provenance of organisms and the pressing need to address conservation issues have expanded the disciplinary boundaries of dispersal ecology. 3. The discussion on the main advances on and challenges for dispersal ecology was the main motivation for the organization of a thematic topic session entitled Dispersal processes driving plant movement: challenges for understanding and predicting range shifts in a changing world at the Annual Meeting of the British Ecological Society (2015, Edinburgh). This session brought together researchers with different types of expertise and interests on dispersal processes and their contributions are now included in this special feature together with a few additional articles. 4. Synthesis. Overall, this special feature illustrates that dispersal ecology spans a broad range of research topics by integrating eight contributions that cover key aspects of this discipline: from conceptual and methodological advances to the study of the ecological and evolutionary outcomes.

Estimating contemporary migration rates: effect and joint inference of inbreeding, null alleles and mistyping	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article						Bayesian inference; dispersal; gene flow; genetic assignment; genotyping errors; microsatellite; pollen and seeds	MICROSATELLITE GENOTYPING ERRORS; GENE FLOW; MULTILOCUS GENOTYPES; POPULATION-STRUCTURE; PARENTAGE ANALYSIS; PLANT-POPULATIONS; BAYESIAN-APPROACH; POLLEN; ASSIGNMENT; INDIVIDUALS	1. Microsatellite-based genetic assignment is used broadly to monitor contemporary effective dispersal among populations. The need to investigate the robustness of this method to common genotyping errors was emphasized more than a decade ago, but it remains unaddressed. 2. We evaluate here for the first time the effect of mistaken and null alleles on estimates of contemporary seed and pollen migration rates obtained with genetic assignment methods. We also introduce a novel Bayesian approach to jointly estimate seed and pollen migration rates, genotyping error rates and null allele frequencies, not requiring independent reference or duplicate genotypic data. 3. Unaccounted-for mistaken alleles caused positive bias and increased the root mean square error (RMSE) of pollen migration rate estimates, whereas seed migration rate estimates were weakly sensitive to mistyping. Jointly estimating mistyping rates minimized the bias and RMSE they introduce on pollen migration estimates, while yielding seed migration rate estimates with similar or slightly larger bias and RMSE than those obtained when ignoring mistyping. 4. Ignoring genotyping errors can be especially problematic when there is no actual migration, because it can lead to the wrong conclusion that there is statistically significant exchange of pollen and/or seeds among populations that are actually isolated. 5. Unaccounted-for null alleles are problematic when among-population pollen dispersal is present, leading to underestimation of pollen migration rates and overestimation of seed migration rates. Jointly estimating null allele frequencies minimized these two biases, reduced the RMSE of seed migration rate estimates and produced relatively small changes in the RMSE of pollen dispersal estimates. 6. Synthesis. Disregarding genotyping errors and null alleles can produce biased and less accurate estimates of the rates at which present-day plant populations are exchanging seed and pollen. An approach is proposed here to minimize the effect of genotyping problems on contemporary migration rate estimates, which should help avoiding erroneous migration inference, monitoring and management, especially when dealing with low migration rates and their associated uncertainty.

J	Jordano, P				Jordano, Pedro			What is long-distance dispersal? And a taxonomy of dispersal events	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article						dispersal; frugivory; plant-animal interactions; pollination; seed dispersal	SEED DISPERSAL; GENE FLOW; PRUNUS-MAHALEB; POLLEN DISPERSAL; PATTERNS; RECRUITMENT; POPULATION; LANDSCAPE; PLANTS; TREES	1. Dispersal is a key individual-based process influencing many life-history attributes and scaling up to population-level properties (e.g. metapopulation connectivity). A persistent challenge in dispersal ecology has been the robust characterization of dispersal functions (kernels), a fundamental tool to predict how dispersal processes respond under global change scenarios. Particularly, the rightmost tail of these functions, that is the long-distance dispersal (LDD) events, are difficult to characterize empirically and to model in realistic ways. 2. But, when is it a LDD event? In the specific case of plants, dispersal has three basic components: (i) a distinct (sessile) source, the maternal plant producing the fruits or the paternal tree acting as a source of pollen; (ii) a distance component between source and target locations; and (iii) a vector actually performing the movement entailing the dispersal event. Here, I discuss operative definitions of LDD based on their intrinsic properties: (i) events crossing geographic boundaries among stands; and (ii) events contributing to effective gene flow and propagule migration. 3. Strict-sense long-distance dispersal involves movement both outside the stand geographic limits and outside the genetic neighbourhood area of individuals. Combinations of propagule movements within/outside these two spatial reference frames result in four distinct modes of LDD. 4. Synthesis. I expect truncation of seed dispersal kernels to have multiple consequences on demography and genetics, following to the loss of key dispersal services in natural populations. Irrespective of neighbourhood sizes, loss of LDD events may result in more structured and less cohesive genetic pools, with increased isolation by distance extending over broader areas. Proper characterization of the LDD events helps to assess, for example, how the ongoing defaunation of large-bodied frugivores pervasively entails the loss of crucial LDD functions.

Impact of Saharan dust events on radionuclide levels in Monaco air and in the water column of the northwest Mediterranean Sea	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RADIOACTIVITY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Environmental Radioactivity (ENVIRA) - New Challenges with New Analytical Technologies	SEP 21-25, 2015	Thessaloniki, GREECE	Aristotle Univ, Int Atom Energy Agcy, Int Union Radioecol, Greek Atom Energy Commiss, Journal Environm Radioactiv, Comenius Univ		Air monitoring; Radionuclides; Saharan dust; Northwest Mediterranean; DYFAMED; Sediment trap	CS-137; DEPOSITION; EXPORT; TRANSPORT; ACCIDENT; METALS; PB-210; FLUXES; INPUTS; SITE	Characterization of atmospheric aerosols collected in Monaco (2004-2008) and in sediment traps at 200 m and 1000 m water depths at the DYFAMED (Dynamics of Atmospheric Fluxes in the Mediterranean Sea) station (2004) was carried out to improve our understanding of the impact of Saharan dust on ground-level air and on the water column. Activity concentrations of natural ((210)pb, Po-210, uranium and radium isotopes) and anthropogenic (Cs-137, (239)pu, (240)m, and Pu239+240) radionuclides and their isotopic ratios confirmed a Saharan impact on the investigated samples. In association with a large particulate matter deposition event in Monaco on 20 February 2004, the Cs-137 (similar to 40 Bq, kg(-1)) and Pu239+24 (similar to 1 Bq kg(-1)) activities were almost a factor of two higher than other Saharan deposition dust events. This single-day particle flux, represented 72% of the annual atmospheric deposition in Monaco. The annual deposition of Saharan dust on the sea was 232-407 mBq 111(-2) for Cs-137 and 6.8-9.8 mBq m(-2) for 239+240PU and contributed significantly (28-37% for Cs-137 and 34-45% for Pu239+240) to the total annual atmospheric input to the northwest Mediterranean Sea. The Cs-137/Pu239+240 activity ratios in dust samples collected during different Saharan dust events confirmed their global fallout origin or mixing with local re-suspended soil particles. In the sediment trap samples the 137Cs activity varied by a factor of two, while the Pu239+240 activity was constant, confirming the different behaviors of Cs (dissolved) and Pu (particle reactive) in the water column. The (CS)-C-137 and Pu239+240 activities of sinking particles during the period of the highest mass flux collected in 20 February 2004 at the 200 m and 1000 m water depths represented about 10% and 15%, respectively, of annual deposition from Saharan dust events.

Be-7 behaviour and meteorological conditions associated with Be-7 peak events in Spain	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RADIOACTIVITY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Environmental Radioactivity (ENVIRA) - New Challenges with New Analytical Technologies	SEP 21-25, 2015	Thessaloniki, GREECE	Aristotle Univ, Int Atom Energy Agcy, Int Union Radioecol, Greek Atom Energy Commiss, Journal Environm Radioactiv, Comenius Univ			STRATOSPHERE-TROPOSPHERE EXCHANGE; GROUND LEVEL AIR; SURFACE AIR; SEASONAL VARIABILITY; OZONE CONCENTRATIONS; PB-210; INTRUSIONS; CLIMATOLOGY; BERYLLIUM-7; ATMOSPHERE	This work regards a comprehensive analysis of the overall distribution of Be-7 activity concentrations in Spain and the synoptic meteorological conditions associated with the highest Be-7 peaks (>8 mBq/m(3)). The use of four sampling stations (Barcelona, Bilbao, Madrid, and Sevilla) included in REMdb, with different latitudinal location, as well as the relatively long time period used in this study (2001-2010), allowed to improve the understanding of Be-7 spatio-temporal distribution in Spain. The comparison of the Be-7 activity concentrations mean values indicated a north-south gradient (from 3.1 +/- 1.1 mBq/m(3) in Bilbao to 4.0 +/- 1.8 mBq/m(3) in Sevilla), even though not statistically significant (as indicated by the t-test). However, the analysis of frequency distributions and temporal evolutions of Be-7 activity concentrations have suggested the presence of two main areas, namely northern (Bilbao and Barcelona) and southern (Sevilla) Spain. The identification and analysis of periods associated with the highest values of Be-7 have allowed studying the different synoptic patterns associated with stratospheric tropospheric transport (SIT). In particular, three episodes (one in the north and two in the south) potentially associated" with vigorous SIT have been identified and analysed in detail. The results displayed that the omega block configuration, extending either over western Russia and Scandinavia or into the Atlantic Ocean, forced the prevailing jet stream to the northeast and south of Spain respectively with subsequent subsidence. In summer, this blocking configuration at high latitudes was combined with the presence of the Azores high pressure system to the west of Spain, affecting the 7Be activity concentration recorded in the south.

Some of them travelled long distances and were detected in places as far from Japan as Spain a few days after the accident. One of these radionuclides was I-131. Its isotope I-129 (T1/2 = 15.7 x 106 years) was also expected to follow the same pathway. In this work, we present the results for the I-128 concentration in the same atmospheric samples from Seville (Spain) where I-131 activity was measured in 2011 by Baeza et al. (2012). I-128 concentrations in aerosol and gaseous samples showed concentrations in the order of 104 and 105 atoms/m(3), typically higher in the gaseous form with respect to the aerosol form. Also 1291 in rainwater was measured, showing concentrations in the order of 10(8) atoms/L. The results show a very good agreement with the I-131 profile, showing that, if background from other sources is not relevant, it is possible to estimate the impact of similar events years after them thanks to the sensitivity of techniques like Accelerator Mass Spectrometry.

Screening of bacterial strains isolated from uranium mill tailings porewaters for bioremediation purposes	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RADIOACTIVITY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Environmental Radioactivity (ENVIRA) - New Challenges with New Analytical Technologies	SEP 21-25, 2015	Thessaloniki, GREECE	Aristotle Univ, Int Atom Energy Agcy, Int Union Radioecol, Greek Atom Energy Commiss, Journal Environm Radioactiv, Comenius Univ		Bioremediation; Biomineralization; Uranium; STEM/HAADF; Porewaters; Bacterial isolates	CONTAMINATED SUBSURFACE SOILS; DISSIMILATORY METAL REDUCTION; MICROBIAL COMMUNITY; BACILLUS-SPHAERICUS; RESISTANT BACTERIA; HEAVY-METALS; WASTE PILES; 16S RDNA; DIVERSITY; GROUNDWATER	The present work characterizes at different levels a number of bacterial strains isolated from porewaters sampled in the vicinity of two French uranium tailing repositories. The 16S rRNA gene from 33 bacterial isolates, corresponding to the different morphotypes recovered, was almost fully sequenced. The resulting sequences belonged to 13 bacterial genera comprised in the phyla Firmicutes, Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria. Further characterization at physiological level and metals/metalloid tolerance provided evidences for an appropriate selection of bacterial strains potentially useful for immobilization of uranium and other common contaminants. By using High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscope (HRTEM), this potential ability to immobilize uranium as U phosphate mineral phases was confirmed for the bacterial strains Br3 and Br5 corresponding to Arthrobacter sp. and Microbacterium oxydans, respectively. Scanning Transmission Electron Microscope- High-Angle Annular Dark-Field (STEMHAADF) analysis showed U accumulates on the surface and within bacterial cytoplasm, in addition to the extracellular space. Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) element-distribution maps demonstrated the presence of U and P within these accumulates. These results indicate the potential of certain bacterial strains isolated from porewaters of U mill tailings for immobilizing uranium, likely as uranium phosphates. Some of these bacterial isolates might be considered as promising candidates in the design of uranium bioremediation strategies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Simultaneous determination of specific alpha and beta emitters by LSC-PLS in water samples	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RADIOACTIVITY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Environmental Radioactivity (ENVIRA) - New Challenges with New Analytical Technologies	SEP 21-25, 2015	Thessaloniki, GREECE	Aristotle Univ, Int Atom Energy Agcy, Int Union Radioecol, Greek Atom Energy Commiss, Journal Environm Radioactiv, Comenius Univ		Alpha emitters; Beta emitters; Simultaneous quantification; Multivariant calibration; Partial least squares	SPECTRA DECONVOLUTION; SCINTILLATION; RADIONUCLIDES; RA-226; TOOLS	Liquid scintillation counting (LSC) is a commonly used technique for the determination of alpha and beta emitters. However, LSC has poor resolution and the continuous spectra for beta emitters hinder the simultaneous determination of several alpha and beta emitters from the same spectrum. In this paper, the feasibility of multivariate calibration by partial least squares (PLS) models for the determination of several alpha (U-nat, Am-241 and Ra-226) and beta emitters (K-40, Co-60, Sr-90/Y-90, Cs-134 and Cs-137) in water samples is reported. A set of alpha and beta spectra from radionuclide calibration standards were used to construct three PLS models. Experimentally mixed radionuclides and intercomparision materials were used to validate the models. The results had a maximum relative bias of 25% when all the radionuclides in the sample were included in the calibration set; otherwise the relative bias was over 100% for some radionuclides. The results obtained show that LSC-PLS is a useful approach for the simultaneous determination of alpha and beta emitters in multi-radionuclide samples. However, to obtain useful results, it is important to include all the radionuclides expected in the studied scenario in the calibration set. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The administrative province of Las Palmas comprises the three eastern Canary Islands (Lanzarote, Fuerteventura and Gran Canaria). An extensive study of terrestrial gamma dose rates in surface soils has been carried out to cover the entire territory of the province (4093 km(2)). The average outdoor gamma dose rate in air at 1 m above ground is 73 nGyh(-1) at Gran Canaria, 32 nGyh(-1) at Fuerteventura, and 25 nGyh(-1) at Lanzarote. To complete the radiological characterization of this volcanic area, 350 soil samples at 0-5 cm depth were collected to cover all the geologic typologies of the islands. These samples were measured using high resolution gamma spectrometry to determine the activity concentrations of Ra-226, Th-232 and K-40. The average values obtained were 25.2 Bq/kg, 28.9 Bq/kg, and 384.4 Bq/kg, respectively. Maps of terrestrial gamma activity, effective dose, and activity concentrations of Ra-226, Th-232 and K-40 for the region have been developed through the use of geostatistical interpolation techniques. These maps are in accord with the geology of the islands. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Arnedo, M. A.; Rubiano, J. G.; Alonso, H.; Tejera, A.; Gonzalez, A.; Gonzalez, J.; Gil, J.

Such plans require radon surveys. The analysis of indoor radon data is supported by the existing knowledge about geogenic radiation. With this aim, we used the terrestrial gamma dose rate data from the MARNA project. In addition, we considered other criterion regarding the surface of Spain, population, permeability of rocks, uranium and radium contain in soils because currently no data are available related to soil radon gas concentration and permeability in Spain. Given that, a Spanish radon map was produced which will be part of the European Indoor Radon Map and a component of the European Atlas of Natural Radiation. The map indicates geographical areas with high probability of finding high indoor radon concentrations. This information will support legislation regarding prevention of radon entry both in dwellings and workplaces. In addition, the map will serve as a tool for the development of strategies at all levels: individual dwellings, local, regional and national administration. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

OSA may underlie the progression to resistant hypertension, partly due to increased activation of the sympathetic nervous system. This analysis of patients with and without OSA evaluated the blood pressure (BP)-lowering effect of sympathetic modulation by renal denervation (RDN) in a real-world setting. Methods: The Global SYMPLICITY Registry (NCT01534299) is a prospective, open-label, multicenter registry conducted worldwide to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of RDN in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. Office and 24-h ambulatory BP were reported for all patients, based on the presence of OSA. Results: Among 1868 patients, self-reported OSA occurred in 205 patients, who were more likely to be men (76 vs 57%, P<0.001), have a higher BMI (34 +/- 6 vs 30 +/- 5kg/m(2), P<0.001), chronic kidney disease (30 vs 21%, P = 0.003), left ventricular hypertrophy (25 vs 15%, P<0.001), and type 2 diabetes (50 vs 36%, P<0.001). Among OSA patients, the baseline office SBP (166 +/- 26 mmHg) was reduced by 14.0 +/- 25.3mmHg at 6 months (P<0.001). Ambulatory 24-h SBP was reduced by 4.9 +/- 18.0mmHg (n = 115, P = 0.005) from 155 +/- 19mmHg at baseline. The 6-month change in SBP from baseline was not statistically different between OSA and non-OSA patients. BP reduction after RDN was also similar in OSA patients already treated with and not treated with continuous positive airway pressure. Conclusion: RDN resulted in significant BP reductions at 6 months in hypertensive patients with and without OSA, and regardless of continuous positive airway pressure usage in OSA patients.

However, information is scant in the context of hypertension. Aim of our study was to evaluate AnxA5 in treated hypertension patients compared with normotensive controls and to determine whether it is associated with vascular and heart TOD evaluated as arterial stiffness, carotid plaque and left ventricular hypertrophy. Methods: We enrolled 123 consecutive treated hypertension and 124 normotensive controls. TOD was evaluated as pulse wave velocity (PWV, complior), left ventricular hypertrophy (echocardiography) and intimamedia thickness and carotid plaque presence (ecographic methods). AnxA5 levels was dosed and compared in patients with and without hypertension and with and without TOD. Results: With similar age hypertension patients showed higher SBP, DBP and AnxA5 levels (13.9 +/- 11.1 vs 10.1 +/- 8.4 ng/ml, P<0.001) compared with controls. Regarding TOD hypertension showed higher PWV (8.5 +/- 1.8 vs 7.6 +/- 1.5 m/s, P<0.001) and LVMI (121.7 +/- 29.3 vs 113.5 +/- 21.1 g/m(2), P<0.05), whereas carotid intima-media thickness was superimposable. AnxA5 correlates with PWV (r = 0.13, P<0.05) and DBP (r = 0.15, P<0.01), whereas it has never been found as a significant independent predictor of TOD in linear regression analysis. Conclusion: Our data have shown that AnxA5 levels are increased in treated hypertension patients. In this condition, it is probably released in the plasma as a defensive mechanism through its anti-inflammatory and anticoagulants effects. We found a significant association with arterial stiffness, but AnxA5 was not found to be a significant predictor of TOD.

Although cerebral microdialysis (CMD) has been used to study the brain neurochemistry, the ionic profiles of brain interstitial space fluid have rarely been reported in humans. We studied the ionic profile in injured areas of the brain by using CMD. As a control group, we included seven patients who had undergone surgical treatment of posterior fossa lesions, without abnormalities in the supratentorial compartment. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was used for ion determination. No significant differences were found in the [Na+](o), [K+](o), and [Cl-](o) between normal injured brains and controls. The ionic profile of the ischemic core was characterized by very high [K+](o) and an increase in [Na+](o), whereas [Cl-](o) was linearly related to [Na+](o). In the traumatic core (TC), significantly higher levels of [Na+](o), [Cl-](o), and [K+](o) were found. The main finding in the penumbra was a completely normal ionic profile for [Na+](o) and [K+](o) in 60% of the samples. ICP-MS coupled to ionic assays creates a powerful tool for a better understanding of the complex ionic disturbances that occur after severe TBI and ischemic stroke.

Systematic research has yet to elucidate or quantify the extent of the role of the catecholamines or adrenocortical and thyroid axis hormonal influences in the condition. Data were prospectively collected on 80 consecutive patients, 18 of whom developed clinical signs of PSH (22.5%). Catecholamine and hormonal data were collected sequentially at 4-h intervals or during and between episodes of PSH. Evaluated variables showed 200-300% increases in catecholamines and, to a lesser extent, adrenocortical hormones during paroxysms. The majority of PSH episodes (72%) were noted to be in response to an observable triggering event. These changes were not observed in subjects without PSH. These data go some way to explain why PSH produces adverse consequences in survivors of TBI with the condition.

Novel ion-doped mesoporous glasses for bone tissue engineering: Study of their structural characteristics influenced by the presence of phosphorous oxide	JOURNAL OF NON-CRYSTALLINE SOLIDS			English	Article						Mesoporosity; Bioactive glasses; Ion-doped glasses; Therapeutic ions; NMR	SOL-GEL GLASSES; BIOACTIVE GLASSES; IN-VITRO; SCAFFOLDS; REGENERATION; DELIVERY; GALLIUM; CERIUM; ZINC	Ion-doped binary SiO2-CaO and ternary SiO2-CaO-P2O5 mesoporous bioactive glasses were synthesized and characterized to evaluate the influence of P2O5 in the glass network structure. Strontium, copper and cobalt oxides in a proportion of 0.8 mol% were selected as dopants because the osteogenic and angiogenic properties reported for these elements. Although the four glass compositions investigated presented analogous textural properties, TEM analysis revealed that the structure of those containing P2O5 exhibited an increased ordered mesoporosity. Furthermore, Si-29 NMR revealed that the incorporation of P2O5 increased the network connectivity and that this compound captured the Sr2+, Cu2+ and Co2+ ions preventing them to behave as modifiers of the silica network. In addition, P-31 NMR results revealed that the nature of the cation directly influences the characteristics of the phosphate clusters. In this study, we have proven that phosphorous oxide entraps doping-metallic ions, granting these glasses with a greater mesopores order. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Evaluation of two glucuronides resistant to enzymatic hydrolysis as markers of testosterone oral administration	JOURNAL OF STEROID BIOCHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY			English	Article						Testosterone; Phase II metabolites; LC-MS/MS; Doping control; Steroid profile	MASS-SPECTROMETRIC ANALYSIS; DOPING CONTROL ANALYSIS; STEROID METABOLITES; ANABOLIC-STEROIDS; HUMAN URINE; T/E RATIO; LC-MS/MS; MISUSE; QUANTIFICATION; POLYMORPHISM	Testosterone (T) has traditionally been the most commonly reported doping agent by doping control laboratories. The screening of T misuse is performed by the quantification of six endogenous androgenic steroids and the ratio included in the Athlete Biological Passport (ABP). The inclusion of additional metabolites can improve the screening capabilities of ABP. In this study, the potential of 3 alpha-glucuronide-6 beta-hydroxyandrosterone (6OH-Andros3G) and 3 alpha-glucuronide-6 beta-hydroxyetiocholanolone (6OH-Etio3G) as markers of T oral administration was evaluated. These glucuronides have been shown to be resistant to enzymatic hydrolysis and their quantification by means of liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was reported as the only way to obtain feasible results. Urine samples were collected from five volunteers before and after the oral administration of 40 mg of T undecanoate and were analyzed by a LC-MS/MS method recently developed. Concentration of 6OH-Andros3G and 6OH-Etio3G compounds and those of the glucuronides of T (TG), epitestosterone (EG), androsterone and etiocholanolone were established and different concentration ratios were calculated. The detection windows (DWs) for the T administration obtained by each selected ratio were compared to the one of TG/EG. The results showed that four out of the nine tested markers presented DWs much larger for all volunteers than those obtained by the World Anti-Doping Agency established T/E marker or other alternative markers. The 6OH-Andros3G/EG, 6OH-Etio3G/EG, 6OH-Andros3G/TG and 6OH-Etio3G/TG markers were able to identify the T abuse up to 96 h after the administration, extending our detection capability for the misuse up to 84 h more than the classic marker. The importance of these markers was also highlighted by their prolonged capacity to detect the T misuse in the case of one volunteer whose TG/EG barely exceeded his individual threshold. As a consequence, the four markers presented in this study seem to have an exceptional potential as biomarkers of T oral administration. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Clave, SA; Wilson, J				Anton Clave, Salvador; Wilson, Julie			The evolution of coastal tourism destinations: a path plasticity perspective on tourism urbanisation	JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE TOURISM			English	Article						Coastal resorts; tourism urbanisation; evolutionary economic geography; path plasticity; cultural political economy; tourism policy	SUSTAINABLE MASS TOURISM; ECONOMIC-GEOGRAPHY; CONVERGENCE; DEPENDENCE; GOVERNANCE; GROWTH; URBAN	Evolutionary and relational approaches to economic development are gaining ground in geography as a discipline, although in the subfield of tourism geography, their potential is only just becoming recognised. This article focuses on the evolution of mature tourism destinations, taking the path dependency concept forward from the notion of path creation into the new domain of path plasticity. Drawing on the notion of cultural political economy, we examine how tourism destinations can break with path dependency routines incrementally and move steadily towards different future paths, which may recast tourism in a different light in the overall urban context of the destination. Using a case study of a Mediterranean coastal destination on Catalonia's Costa Daurada, we explore the inter-tangled tourism and urban development processes in relation to the socio-spatial dimensions of urban change. The article argues for a wider range of social and cultural criteria in the analysis of tourism evolution - advocating the use of path plasticity and a cultural political economy approach - to offer an alternative perspective on shifting tourism situations, reflecting the inherently urbanising nature of tourism development in the traditional coastal resort context. It adds to the growing literature on governance and strategy-making in sustainable tourism.

Objective: To compare the efficacy and safety of secukinumab and ustekinumab use over 52 weeks. Methods: Analysis of 52-week data from CLEAR, a randomized, double-blind, phase 3b study. Results: Among 676 randomized subjects, secukinumab demonstrated superiority to ustekinumab at week 52 in the proportion of subjects with >= 90% improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 90) (76% vs 61% [P<.0001]); PASI 100 responses were 46% versus 36% (P = .0103) and Investigator's Global Assessment responses of clear/almost clear skin were 80% versus 65% (P < .0001). Subjects on secukinumab reported greater reductions in psoriasis-related pain, itching, and scaling, and greater improvement across all quality-of-life measures evaluated (Dermatology Life Quality Index [DLQI], EuroQoL 5-Dimension Health Questionnaire, Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire-Psoriasis, and Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index). At week 52, 72% of subjects on secukinumab versus 59% on ustekinumab (P = .0008) reported no impact of skin disease on their lives (DLQI 0/1 response). Safety and tolerability was comparable. Limitations: There was no placebo arm. Conclusion: In this head-to-head, double-blind study, secukinumab demonstrated sustained superior efficacy in comparison with ustekinumab in clearing skin through week 52, greater improvement in quality of life, and a favorable and comparable safety profile.

We calculate the interaction length between sets of two and three pulses as a function of the ratio of dissimilar peak powers of interacting solitons by means of a variational approach to the generalized nonlinear Schrodinger equation describing the evolution of optical soliton pulses. We find a maximum of this colliding length for specific values of pulse energies. The effect of higher-order perturbation terms, such as third-order dispersion, Raman scattering, and self-steepening, shows an enhancement of the interaction distance in a broad range of dispersion difference values.

Rapid internationalization and long-term performance: The knowledge link	JOURNAL OF WORLD BUSINESS			English	Article						Internationalization; Firm performance; Speed; Knowledge-based view; Organizational learning theory	R-AND-D; FIRM PERFORMANCE; MULTINATIONAL-CORPORATION; BORN-GLOBALS; DIVERSIFICATION DISCOUNT; PRODUCT DIVERSIFICATION; EMERGING ECONOMIES; STRATEGY RESEARCH; ENTRY MODE; SPEED	Drawing on the knowledge-based view and organizational learning theory, we develop and test a set of hypotheses to provide a first attempt at analyzing the effect of speed of internationalization on long-term performance. Using a panel -data sample of Spanish listed firms (1986-2010), we find that there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between speed of internationalization and long-term performance. We also find that whereas technological knowledge steepens this relationship, the diversity of prior international experience flattens it. Our results contribute to the existing IB literature on the performance of FDI, cross-country knowledge transferability, and nonsequential entry. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

We aimed to assess the persistence of bactericidal antibodies up to 4 years after a three-dose schedule of bivalent rLP2086. Methods We did this randomised, single-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial at 25 sites in Australia, Poland, and Spain. In stage 1 of the study (February, 2009 May, 2010), healthy adolescents (aged 11-18 years) were randomly assigned, via an interactive voice and web-response system with computer-generated sequential random numbers, to receive either ascending doses of vaccine (60 mu g, 120 mu g, and 200 mu g) or placebo at months 0, 2, and 6. Dispensing staff were not masked to group allocation, but allocation was concealed from principal investigators, participants and their guardians, and laboratory personnel. In stage 2 of the study (reported here), we enrolled healthy adolescents who had received three doses of 120 mu g bivalent rLP2086 (the optimum dose level identified in stage 1) or saline. Immunogenicity was determined in serum bactericidal antibody assay using human complement (hSBA) by use of four meningococcal serogroup B test strains expressing vaccine-heterologous factor H binding protein variants: PMB80 (A22), PMB2001 (A56), PMB2948 (B24), and PMB2707 (B44). Immunogenicity in stage 2 was assessed at months 6, 12, 24, and 48 post-vaccination. We did analysis by intention to treat. This trial is registered as ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT00808028. Findings Between March 17, 2010, and Feb 8, 2011, 170 participants who received 120 mu g of bivalent rLP2086 and 80 participants who received placebo in stage 1 of the study were entered into stage 2; 210 participants completed stage 2 up to 48 months. 1 month after the third vaccination, 93% (n=139/149) to 100% (n=48/48) of vaccine recipients achieved protective hSBA titres equal to or greater than the lower limit of quantification to each test strain, compared with 0% (n=0/25) to 35% (n=8/23) of control recipients. Despite initial declines in seroprotective hSBA titres for all four test strains, for three test strains (A22, A56, and B24), more than 50% of bivalent rLP2086 recipients continued to achieve titres equal to or greater than the lower limit of quantification at months 6 (57% [n=93/163] to 89% [n=42/47]),12 (54% [n=84/155] to 69% [n=33/48]), 24 (53% [n=26/49] to 54% [n=82/152]), and 48 (51% [n=24/47] to 59% [n=79/134]); corresponding values in the control group were 14% (n=11/80) to 22% (n=5/23) at month 6, 13% (n=10/78) to 29% (n=22/76) at month 12, 16% (n=12/74) to 36% (n=8/22) at month 24, and 24% (n=16/68) to 35% (n=8/23) at month 48. For test strain B44, hSBA titres equal to or greater than the lower limit of quantification were shown in 37% (n=18/49) of vaccine recipients at 6 months, in 29% (n=14/48) at 12 months, in 22% (n=11/49) at 24 months, and in 20% (n=10/49) at 48 months, compared with 0% (n=0/25) of control recipients at month 6, 4% (n=1/25) at months 12 and 24, and 12% (n=3/25) at month 48. Adverse events were reported in seven (4%) of 170 participants in the bivalent rLP2086 group and two (3%) of 80 participants in the control group; no event was deemed related to vaccine. Interpretation. After three doses of bivalent rLP2086, protective hSBA titres above the correlate of protection (>= 1/4) were elicited up to 4 years in more than 50% of participants for three of four meningococcal serogroup B test strains representative of disease-causing meningococci expressing vaccine-heterologous antigens. Further studies will be needed to assess possible herd immunity effects with meningococcal serogroup B vaccines and the need for a booster dose to sustain individual protection against invasive meningococcal disease.

Seasonal variation in vertebrate traffic casualties and its implications for mitigation measures	LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING			English	Article						Road mortality; Hotspot; Road ecology; Seasonality; Survey planning	NEW-SOUTH-WALES; TOAD BUFO-BUFO; ROAD MORTALITY; VEHICLE COLLISIONS; SPATIAL-PATTERNS; NATIONAL-PARK; AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPE; HIGHWAY MORTALITY; WESTERN POLAND; GENE FLOW	Wildlife mortality on roads is a global conservation problem. To implement a cost-effective programme of mitigation measures, it is essential to determine spatial and temporal patterns of traffic collisions. Identifying seasonal road-collision patterns could make it possible to schedule and optimize monitoring programmes. We evaluated seasonal variation in the roadkills of four vertebrate taxonomic groups (amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals) across an environmental gradient in northeastern Iberia. Seven roads were monitored twice a month for one year and seasonal roadkill aggregations were examined using Poisson tests. Roadkill patterns were correlated with environmental variables using Generalized Linear Models. Amphibians were the group most commonly killed. Overall, the roadkill pattern was seasonal, and most roads showed seasonal peaks of casualties in autumn and spring. Roadkill peaks showed slightly seasonal differences between taxonomic groups. The total number of roadkill incidents was positively associated with temperature and negatively associated with solar irradiance. The road kill numbers by group were related to different environmental factors: amphibian roadkills increased with relative humidity, while this relationship was negative for birds; mammal roadkills were associated with temperature, and reptile roadkills correlated with precipitation, solar irradiance, and temperature. Our results suggest that roadkill rates in Catalonia are seasonal and mostly associated with several climatic factors, although they can vary depending on taxonomic group and environmental factors. Our results highlight the fact that an understanding of seasonal variation in roadkills is critical for optimizing monitoring programmes and temporary mitigation measures aimed at particular species or taxonomic groups.

The work presented here analyses the importance of ornamental tree distribution and investigates airborne pollen records using volumetric spore traps. Three localities in the southwest of Spain were studied: Don Benito (DB), Plasencia (PL), and Zafra (ZA), in the Extremadura region. Volumetric Hirst type spore traps recorded pollen levels continuously for three years. Ornamental street trees in the study area were identified, counted and mapped. Airborne pollen records were found to be related to the number of trees, the proximity of the trees to traps, the different pollination systems and wind direction. A total of 17635 trees, from all localities were counted, belonging to 67 species, 58% anemophilous, 22% entomophilous, and 20% both pollination systems. Five species represented more than 50% of the total number of ornamental trees: Platanus hispanica, Olea europaea, litmus minor, Acer negundo and Melia azedarach. The average total pollen concentration in gm(-3) was 102 (DB), 93 (PL), and 99 (ZA)... Omitting the data for Quercus pollen, a statistically significant correlation between the number of trees at 0.5 km around the spore traps and the types of pollen recorded was found. Some measures to decrease the amount of potential allergenic airborne pollen in urban environments were identified, such as reducing trees with anemophilic pollination systems, eliminating male trees and employing suitable pruning practices. In any case, the closer the source of ornamental pollen, the greater the allergenic risks. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The sediments are reddish to grey limestones and marls of the Scaglia Group and marls with volcaniclastic deposits of the Bisciaro Formation. The aim was to examine the evolutionary trend of what is probably the most debated trace fossil of all time, from the Upper Cretaceous to Lower Miocene. Despite having been found in beds ranging from the Cambrian to the present, no consensus has been reached regarding mode of construction, tracemaker or ethological explanation for Zoophycos. Four Zoophycos morphotypes are recognized at Gubbio showing variations of major and minor lamellae, apex, lobes and whorls: the Cretaceous-Eocene cone-shaped type 1, the Upper Eocene-Middle Oligocene helicoidal type 2, the Oligocene lobate type 3 and the Upper Oligocene-Lower Miocene flat type 4. The very high ichnodensity in some beds (hundreds of specimens in discrete levels of the Bisciaro Formation, now destroyed by quarrying) seems to find explanation in abnormal concentrations of phytodetritus and organic matter on the seafloor in some periods. This very high abundance in discrete levels reflects a change in sedimentation and seafloor conditions at pre-flysch deposition. Due to such high ichnodensity, many adjacent specimens display deformed outer margins. Taphonomic analysis shows a variation of whorls, laminae and U-shaped lobes, reflecting ontogenetic development of the tracemaker(s) (?sipunculid worms).

Grounding on 1, the discovery of a new, exceptionally preserved Amphisauropus trackway (Permian Orobic Basin, Northern Italy), showing continuous tail and pedal scratch impressions; and 2, a comparative analysis of track and bony records, we provide a first synapomorphy-based attribution of Amphisauropus tracks to their most plausible producers, seymouriamorph reptiliomorphs, and propose a detailed reconstruction of the locomotion biomechanics in this group. The markedly sinuous and continuous tail impression with a relatively constant width, the curve arrangement of pedal scratches and the inferred position of head, trunk and tail during the locomotion suggest large lateral movements, while vertical movements were nearly absent, consistently with a primitive sprawling gait. We also document the functional prevalence of the hindlimbs and provide a detailed description of femur biomechanics during step cycle. Trackway parameters suggest that the speed was quite slow: a comparison with a large database of Amphisauropus trackways from Italy and Germany proves that this peculiar preservation was gait-and substrate-related, rather than trackmaker-related. In all, this study sheds light on the locomotion of Seymouriamorpha and aimed to contribute to a full integration of track and skeletal data in exploring locomotory biomechanics of extinct tetrapods.

Principal component analysis (PCA) and thin-plate splines (TPSs) based on a pooled sample of 359 specimens from four sections in the Guizhou Province, south China, demonstrated that the shape of this species is very constant, and only a small difference is detected in specimens from deeper part of the basin. Most of the variation is taphonomically controlled, and only the specimens from Sanwan Section show a modest natural difference due to a slightly different depositional environment. A comparison between the Chinese specimens and Oryctocephalus 'reticulatus' from the Molodo Section, Siberia, has been carried out. PCA and TPS show that O. 'reticulatus occupies the same morphospace of O. indicus. However, the canonical variates analysis and the analysis of similarities detect small differences between the Siberian and Chinese populations, indicating a minor geographical variation caused by different environmental settings. The ontogenic variation is also described from early meraspids to holaspids. The most substantial changes take place during the first period of the early meraspid development, in which the glabella changes from a bell-like shape to a cylindrical shape. The ocular ridge changes from poorly defined in early meraspid to well developed in late merapids. The results indicate that O. 'reticulatus' is a junior synonym of O. indicus, suggesting that the base O. indicus of Siberia can be correlated with the O. indicus Zone of south China.

Ebola virus is responsible for the fatal Ebola virus disease (EVD). 2. Identifying the distribution area of the Ebola virus is crucial for understanding the risk factors conditioning the emergence of new EVD cases. Existing distribution models have underrepresented the potential contribution that reservoir species and vulnerable species make in sustaining the presence of the virus. 3. In this paper, we map favourable areas for Ebola virus in Africa according to environmental and zoogeographical descriptors, independent of human-to-human transmissions. We combine two different biogeographical approaches: analysis of mammalian distribution types (chorotypes), and distribution modelling of the Ebola virus. 4. We first obtain a model defining the distribution of environmentally favourable areas for the presence of Ebola virus. Based on a review of mammal taxa affected by or suspected of exposure to the Ebola virus, we model favourable areas again, this time according to mammalian chorotypes. We then build a combined model in which both the environment and mammalian distributions explain the favourable areas for Ebola virus in the wild. 5. We demonstrate that mammalian biogeography contributes to explaining the distribution of Ebola virus in Africa, although vegetation may also underscore clear limits to the presence of the virus. Our model suggests that the Ebola virus may be even more widespread than previously suspected, given that additional favourable areas are found throughout the coastal areas of West and Central Africa, stretching from Cameroon to Guinea, and extend further East into the East African Lakes region. 6. Our findings show that the most favourable area for the Ebola virus is significantly associated with the presence of the virus in non-human mammals. Core areas are surrounded by regions of intermediate favourability, in which human infections of unknown source were found. The difference in association between humans and other mammals and the virus may offer further insights on how EVD can spread.

Knowledge of the spatial ecology of mammalian carnivores is critical for understanding species' biology and designing effective conservation and management interventions. We reviewed the available information about the spatial ecology of jaguars Panthera onca, pumas Puma concolor, and ocelots Leopardus pardalis, and we examined how sex and extrinsic variables affect their spatial behaviour. 2. Sixty-one articles addressing home range, home range overlap, daily net displacement (straight-line distance between two locations on consecutive days), and/or distance of dispersal of the three species were included. Meta-analysis, ANOVA, ANCOVA, and beta regression tests were run to analyse differences among species and sexes and to elucidate the influence of other variables, such as latitude and ecoregion, on spatial behaviour. 3. Pumas had on average larger home ranges (mean +/- SE: 281.87 +/- 35.76 km(2)) than jaguars (128.61 +/- 49.5 km(2)) and ocelots (12.46 +/- 3.39 km(2)). Intersexual range overlap was higher than intrasexual range overlap in jaguars and pumas. Sex affected the home range size of all three species, but only influenced daily net displacement in ocelots. Ecoregion affected the home range size of all three species but did not significantly affect either the daily net displacement or the dispersal distance of pumas. Latitude affected the home range size of jaguars and pumas. It did not affect daily net displacement or dispersal distance in jaguars and pumas, but did affect daily net displacement in ocelots. 4. Although there was a lack of studies in most countries for the three species, information was particularly lacking in the Neotropics for jaguars and pumas and in North America for ocelots. Researchers usually presented low sample sizes and used different methods to examine the ecological issues considered here. Homogenisation of methods is needed to clarify the ecology of these species and to allow a better understanding of the threats to their populations.

A proposal for verification tests for the flicker measurement procedure of grid-connected wind turbines	MEASUREMENT			English	Article						Power quality; Voltage fluctuations; Flicker; Wind turbines	MITIGATION; STRATEGY; POWER	This paper presents a set of verification tests to assist the accurate implementation of flicker measurement in wind turbines. The flicker measurement procedure is defined in the IEC 61400-21 standard, which includes the estimation of a fictitious grid in order to measure voltage fluctuations generated exclusively by the wind turbine. The large margin in the digital implementation of the fictitious grid can result in large deviations in flicker measurements between different instrument manufacturers. This work shows the need of a verification test protocol to minimize the potential divergences. Furthermore, it suggests a set of five tests aimed at guaranteeing the accurate implementation of two specific components of the fictitious grid, namely the estimation of the electrical angle of the mains frequency and the derivative of the line current measured at the wind turbine terminals. The work has been proposed to the IEC Maintenance Team TC88/MT21 for it to be included in the third edition of the standard. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Redondo, K.; Gutierrez, J.

Quantifying the influence of rain in LiDAR performance	MEASUREMENT			English	Article						LiDAR; Autonomous vehicle; Meteorology	SYSTEMS; CLASSIFICATION	LiDAR systems emerge as one of the key systems for autonomous vehicles. The present work quantifies the influence of rain in different LiDAR parameters: range, intensity, and number of detected points. Six areas with different target materials are used for the study. Range measurements appear stable even under important rain affectation. The variations are always lower than 20 cm. These variations come from the experimental procedure (averaging of points detected from a surface) and not from the instabilities in the LiDAR detection with rain. The detected LiDAR intensity and the sampled points attenuate with the increasing of rain intensity. Drop size distribution is assumed constant along the study area. The highest decrease in the number of points appears for pavement. However, the intensity returned from pavement is not specially influenced by rain. The rest of the materials show similar trend in the intensity and the number of detected points. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Here, the periodic signal was transformed into a rectangular wave and the interval of time between two consecutive positive edges of this rectangular wave was estimated. First, in order to estimate this interval of time, a counter was used to count the number of clock pulses that have occurred during every interval of this type. In this case, the clock frequency was the sampling frequency. Next, this process was repeated several times and a vector of estimated values of the period of the signal was created. After that, this vector was considered as a random sample and it was used to create thousands of resamples with the same size as the above-mentioned random sample and that were created by sampling with replacement from the original random sample. Then, for each resample, the sample mean was calculated and the inverse of the mean of these sample means was used as an estimation of the frequency of the signal. Finally, a prototype of this statistic method to frequency estimation was built. The results of the experiment were satisfactory. (C) 2016 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Using their IL-6 receptor a-chain (IL-6R alpha), Sirp alpha(+) DCs trans-presented IL-6 to T cells during the process of cognate interaction. While ambient IL-6 was sufficient to suppress the induction of expression of the transcription factor Foxp3 in T cells, trans-presentation of IL-6 by DC-bound IL-6R alpha (called 'IL-6 cluster signaling' here) was needed to prevent premature induction of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) expression in T cells and to generate pathogenic T(H)17 cells in vivo. Our findings should guide therapeutic approaches for the treatment of T(H)17-cell-mediated autoimmune diseases.

Recent findings show that boosting prefrontal cortex synaptic plasticity potentiates fear extinction, suggesting that therapies that augment synaptic plasticity could prove useful in rescue of fear extinction impairments in this group of disorders. Previously, we reported that mice with selective deregulation of neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor, type 3 expression (TgNTRK3) exhibit increased fear memories accompanied by impaired extinction, congruent with an altered activation pattern of the amygdala-hippocampus-medial prefrontal cortex fear circuit. Here we explore the specific role of neurotrophin 3 and its cognate receptor in the medial prefrontal cortex, and its involvement in fear extinction in a pathological context. In this study we combined molecular, behavioral, in vivo pharmacology and ex vivo electrophysiological recordings in TgNTRK3 animals during contextual fear extinction processes. We show that neurotrophin 3 protein levels are increased upon contextual fear extinction in wild-type animals but not in TgNTRK3 mice, which present deficits in infralimbic long-term potentiation. Importantly, infusion of neurotrophin 3 to the medial prefrontal cortex of TgNTRK3 mice rescues contextual fear extinction and ex vivo local application improves medial prefrontal cortex synaptic plasticity. This effect is blocked by inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation through peripheral administration of SL327, suggesting that rescue occurs via this pathway. Our results suggest that stimulating neurotrophin 3-dependent medial prefrontal cortex plasticity could restore contextual fear extinction deficit in pathological fear and could constitute an effective treatment for fear-related disorders.

However, a direct causal relationship between 5-HT hypo-transmission and memory and underlying mechanisms has not been established. We used mice with a constitutive depletion of 5-HT brain levels (Petl KO mice) to analyze the contribution of 5-HT to different forms of leaming and memory. Pet/KO mice exhibited a striking deficit in novel object recognition memory, a hippocampal-dependent task No alterations were found in tasks for social recognition, procedural leaming, or fear memory. Viral delivery of designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs was used to selectively silence the activity of 5-HT neurons in the raphe. Inhibition of 5-HT neurons in the median raphe, but not the dorsal raphe, was sufficient to impair object recognition in adult mice. In vivo electrophysiology in behaving mice showed that long-term potentiation in the hippocampus of 5-HT-deficient mice was altered, and administration of the 5-HT IA agonist 8-OHDPAT rescued the memory deficits. Our data suggest that hyposerotonergia selectively affects declarative hippocampal-dependent memory. Serotonergic projections from the median raphe are necessary to regulate object memory and hippocampal synaptic plasticity processes, through an inhibitory control mediated by 5-HT1A receptors.

Here we report the discovery of a new first-in-class small-molecule (CM-414) that acts as a dual inhibitor of PDE5 and HDACs. We have used this compound as a chemical probe to validate this systems therapeutics strategy, where an increase in the activation of cAMP/cGMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) induced by PDE5 inhibition, combined with moderate HDAC class I inhibition, leads to efficient histone acetylation. This molecule rescued the impaired long-term potentiation evident in hippocampal slices from APP/PSI mice. Chronic treatment of Tg2576 mice with CM-414 diminished brain A beta and tau phosphorylation (pTau) levels, increased the inactive form of GSK3P, reverted the decrease in dendritic spine density on hippocampal neurons, and reversed their cognitive deficits, at least in part by inducing the expression of genes related to synaptic transmission. Thus, CM-414 may serve as the starting point to discover balanced dual inhibitors with an optimal efficacy and safety profile for clinical testing on AD patients.

Herein we present a detailed taphonomic study of Somosaguas-North (Madrid Basin, Spain), a Middle Miocene mammalian-dominated site embedded in debris-flow deposits, in order to increase our knowledge of the mode of formation of fossiliferous assemblages in this depositional context. The assemblage includes 6592 large-mammal remains belonging to at least 10 different species. Fossils are found in matrix-supported, poorly-sorted coarse arkosic sandstones and fine conglomerates, which are interpreted as the result of successive debris-flow deposits. Breakage constitutes a pervasive taphonomic alteration in the bone assemblage; however, together with unidentifiable bone fragments, we also found complete to almost complete skeletal elements. Bone remains are isolated, a fact that is indicative of a time of exposure of the carcasses long enough to enable decay and complete disarticulation. There are no associations of elements belonging to the same individual, which suggests that, prior to or during debris-flow transport, bones were profusely dispersed. Based on the taphonomic evidence, we suggest that Somosaguas-North assemblage was formed by successive debris-flow transport and burial of pre-existing thanatocoenoses. Bones from those thanatocoenoses were modified by biostratinomic agents (trampling, weathering) in varying degrees depending on their time of exposure. Debris-flow transport produced further abrasion and breakage in collagen-depleted bones. Our results are congruent with an environmental context of semiarid landscapes presenting long arid periods and highly irregular hydrological seasonality. Finally, we compared the Somosaguas-North assemblage with other debris-flow hosted vertebrate assemblages. Although Somosaguas-North shares taphonomic features with some of these sites, it is not possible to define consistent and single taphonomic patterns for debris-flow assemblages, given the varied taphonomic histories of the remains prior to and during debris-flow transport.

Svalbard ice-sheet decay after the Last Glacial Maximum: New insights from micropalaeontological and organic biomarker paleoceanographical reconstructions	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY			English	Article						Svalbard; Barents Sea; Deglaciation; Holocene; Microfossils; Dinocysts; Biomarkers	NORTHERN NORTH-ATLANTIC; SEA-SURFACE CONDITIONS; TROUGH-MOUTH FANS; DINOFLAGELLATE CYST ASSEMBLAGES; HOLOCENE THERMAL MAXIMUM; NORTHWESTERN BARENTS SEA; EASTERN NORWEGIAN SEA; MELTWATER PULSE 1A; NORDIC SEAS; THERMOHALINE CIRCULATION	A marine sediment core retrieved from the middle continental slope of the northwestern Barents Sea was analyzed for its geochemical (alkenones) and micropalaeontological (diatoms, coccolithophores and dinocyst) content in order to reconstruct the evolution of upper ocean conditions and ice-sheet dynamics during the last 25 kyr. Additionally, quantitative reconstructions of sea surface conditions (temperature, salinity and sea-ice cover extent) were conducted based on the best analogue technique applied to dinocyst assemblages and on the alkenone unsaturation index. The sediment core contains a post Last Glacial Maximum depositional sequence unaffected by stratigraphic discontinuities. Low salinity and laminated sediments after 20 cal kyr BP, indicate a massive settling of meltwater sediment-laden plumes from the initial melting of the Svalbard-Barents Sea Ice Sheet on Western Svalbard. First record of measurable alkenones, together with a drop of the number of months of sea-ice cover and increase in SSTs suggests an intensification of the influx of Atlantic waters into the study area at similar to 15 cal kyr BP representing the termination of the last glacial period and onset of the Bolling interstadial. The first occurrence of diatoms and increase in the abundance of all microfossils marked the onset of the Holocene at 11.2 cal kyr BP when modem-type sea surface conditions were rapidly established in Western Svalbard. Reconstructions based on dinocyst data and alkenone unsaturation index suggest relatively warm and stable temperatures between 9.9 and 8.9 kyr BP and a decrease of SSTs from 4.2 cal kyr BP to present coinciding with the Holocene Thermal Maximum and the decrease of summer insolation in the high latitude northern hemisphere, respectively.

Samples were taken from eight new sites representing different palaeoenvironments including coastal wetlands and floodplains, in order to assess the fish diversity and to gain a better understanding of the last dinosaur-dominated ecosystems of northeastern Spain. The results suggest that a diverse ichthyofauna inhabited these transitional to inland fluvial settings throughout the Maastrichtian, comprising both marine and freshwater taxa. Three different chondrichthyans, eight basal neopterygians and at least seven teleostean species were found, the latter being more diverse than in other Maastrichtian localities in Europe. Fossil evidence from the studied late Maastrichtian assemblages suggests that teleosteans were present in all the trophic guilds. In addition, the oldest records for osteoglossids and perciforms in Europe, as well as for cypriniforms worldwide, are reported here. The findings from the southern Pyrenees also reveal ichthyofaunal turnover during the Late Cretaceous, with 'holosteans' being replaced by teleosteans. Moreover, Maastrichtian ichthyofaunas from the southern PyreneeS show Asian and North American biogeographical affinities. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The effects of silica content, polymer addition and suspension dilution with water were examined. The turbidimetry method was applied to examine stability of the investigated systems as a function of time. It was shown that the suspension without polymer was characterized by the smallest stability, whereas the systems containing PVP (before and after dilution) are successively stable. The specific conformation of PVP chains on the solid surface is responsible for the stabilization-flocculation properties of PVP in the colloidal suspension.

Furthermore, serum free testosterone, which is the active form of testosterone, seems to correlate with intraprostatic testosterone. Here we compared free and total serum testosterone as predictors of survival free of castration resistance. METHODSTotal testosterone (chemiluminescent assay, lower sensitivity 10ng/dl) and free testosterone (analogue-ligand radioimmunoassay, lower sensitivity 0.05pg/ml) were determined at 6 months of LHRH agonist treatment in a prospective cohort of 126 patients with prostate cancer. During a mean follow-up of 67 months (9-120), 75 (59.5%) events of castration-resistant progression were identified. Multivariate analysis and survival analysis according to total testosterone cutoffs of 50, 32, and 20ng/dl, and free testosterone cutoffs of 1.7, 1.1, and 0.7pg/ml were performed. RESULTSMetastatic spread was the most powerful predictor of castration resistance, HR: 2.09 (95%CI: 1.18-3.72), P=0.012. Gleason score, baseline PSA and PSA at 6 months were also independents predictors, but not free and total testosterone. Stratified analysis was conducted on the basis of the status of metastatic diseases and free testosterone was found to be an independent predictor of survival free of castration resistance in the subgroup of patients without metastasis, HR: 2.12 (95%CI: 1.16-3.85), P=0.014. The lowest threshold of free testosterone which showed significant differences was 1.7pg/ml, P=0.003. CONCLUSIONSFree testosterone at 6 months of LHRH agonist treatment seems to be a better surrogate than total testosterone to predict castration resistance in no metastatic prostate cancer patients.

Gut Microbiota, Bacterial Translocation, and Interactions with Diet: Pathophysiological Links between Major Depressive Disorder and Non Communicable Medical Comorbidities	PSYCHOTHERAPY AND PSYCHOSOMATICS			English	Article						Mood disorders; Obesity; Depression; Diabetes; Microbiota; Chronic fatigue syndrome; Inflammation; Psychiatry; Irritable bowel syndrome; Oxidative stress	IRRITABLE-BOWEL-SYNDROME; CHRONIC-FATIGUE-SYNDROME; GRAM-NEGATIVE ENTEROBACTERIA; RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIALS; MESENTERIC LYMPH-NODES; C-REACTIVE PROTEIN; NITROSATIVE STRESS; OXIDATIVE STRESS; ADIPOSE-TISSUE; IMMUNE-SYSTEM	Background: Persistent low-grade immune-inflammatory processes, oxidative and nitrosative stress (O&NS), and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activation are integral to the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD). The microbiome, intestinal compositional changes, and resultant bacterial translocation add a new element to the bidirectional interactions of the gut -brain axis; new evidence implicates these pathways in the patho-aetiology of MDD. In addition, abnormalities in the gut-brain axis are associated with several chronic non-communicable disorders, which frequently co-occur in individuals with MDD, including but not limited to irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), obesity, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Methods: We searched the PubMed/MEDLINE database up until May 1, 2016 for studies which investigated intestinal dysbiosis and bacterial translocation (the 'leaky gut') in the pathophysiology of MDD and co-occurring somatic comorbidities with an emphasis on IBS, CFS, obesity, and T2DM. Results: The composition of the gut microbiota is influenced by several genetic and environmental factors (e.g. diet). Several lines of evidence indicate that gut-microbiotadiet interactions play a significant pathophysiological role in MDD and related medical comorbidities. Gut dysbiosis and the leaky gut may influence several pathways implicated in the biology of MDD, including but not limited to immune activation, O&NS, and neuroplasticity cascades. However, methodological inconsistencies and limitations limit comparisons across studies. Conclusions: Intestinal dysbiosis and the leaky gut may constitute a key pathophysiological link between MDD and its medical comorbidities. This emerging literature opens relevant preventative and therapeutic perspectives. (C) 2016 S.

The Remote Observatories of the Southeastern Association for Research in Astronomy (SARA)	PUBLICATIONS OF THE ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY OF THE PACIFIC			English	Article						telescopes	SPIRAL GALAXIES; BINARY; PERIOD; SYSTEM; STARS	We describe the remote facilities operated by the Southeastern Association for Research in Astronomy (SARA), a consortium of colleges and universities in the US partnered with Lowell Observatory, the Chilean National Telescope Allocation Committee, and the Instituto de Astrofisica de Canarias. SARA observatories comprise a 0.96 m telescope at Kitt Peak, Arizona; one of 0.6 m aperture on Cerro Tololo, Chile; and the 1 m Jacobus Kapteyn Telescope at the Roque de los Muchachos, La Palma, Spain. All are operated using standard VNC or Radmin protocols communicating with on-site PCs. Remote operation offers considerable flexibility in scheduling, allowing long-term observational cadences difficult to achieve with classical observing at remote facilities, as well as obvious travel savings. Multiple observers at different locations can share a telescope for training, educational use, or collaborative research programs. Each telescope has a CCD system for optical imaging, using thermoelectric cooling to avoid the need for frequent local service, and a second CCD for offset guiding. The Arizona and Chile telescopes also have fiber-fed echelle spectrographs. Switching between imaging and spectroscopy is very rapid, so a night can easily accommodate mixed observing modes.

J	Montagna, M; Lux, T				Montagna, Mattia; Lux, Thomas			Contagion risk in the interbank market: a probabilistic approach to cope with incomplete structural information	QUANTITATIVE FINANCE			English	Article						Contagion; Interbank market; Network models; D85; G21; D83	OVERNIGHT MONEY MARKET; FINANCIAL NETWORKS; SYSTEMIC RISK	One lesson of the financial crisis erupting in 2008 has been that domino effects constitute a serious threat to the stability of the financial sector, i.e. the failure of one node in the interbank network might entail the danger of contagion to large parts of the entire system. How important this effect is, depends on the exact topology of the network on which the supervisory authorities have typically very incomplete knowledge. In order to explore the extent of contagion effects and to analyse the effectiveness of macroprudential measures to contain such effects, a reconstruction of the quantitative features of the empirical network would be needed. We propose a probabilistic approach to such a reconstruction: we propose to combine some important known quantities (like the size of the banks) with a realistic stochastic representation of the remaining structural elements. Our approach allows us to evaluate relevant measures for the contagion risk after default of one unit (i.e. the number of expected subsequent defaults, or their probabilities). For some quantities we are able to derive closed form solutions, others can be obtained via computational mean-field approximations.

Traditional genetic modifications in animals relied on a classical toolbox that, aside from some technical improvements and additions, remained unchanged for many years. Classical methods involved direct delivery of DNA sequences into embryos or the use of embryonic stem cells for those few species (mice and rats) where it was possible to establish them. For livestock, the advent of somatic cell nuclear transfer platforms provided alternative, but technically challenging, approaches for the genetic alteration of loci at will. However, the entire landscape changed with the appearance of different classes of genome editors, from initial zinc finger nucleases, to transcription activator-like effector nucleases and, most recently, with the development of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated proteins (Cas). Gene editing is currently achieved by CRISPR-Cas-mediated methods, and this technological advancement has boosted our capacity to generate almost any genetically altered animal that can be envisaged.

Embryos secrete a variety of autocrine and paracrine factors and, of these, extracellular vesicles have recently been implicated as putative messengers in embryo-embryo communication, as well as in communication of the embryo with the maternal tract. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are membrane-bound vesicles that are found in biofluids and in culture media conditioned by the presence of embryos or cells. EVs carry and transfer regulatory molecules, such as microRNAs, mRNAs, lipids and proteins. We conducted a systematic search of the literature to review and present the currently available evidence regarding the possible roles of EVs in in vitro embryo communication and embryo development. It is important to note that there is limited information available on the molecular mechanisms and many of the biologically plausible functions of EVs in embryo communication have not yet been substantiated by conclusive experimental evidence. However, indirect evidence, such as the use of media conditioned by embryos or by somatic cells with improved embryo development as a result, may indicate that EVs can be an important asset for the development of tailor-made media, allowing better embryo development in vitro, even for single embryo culture.

To examine how these processes are modulated by the emotional salience of the stimuli, we studied the attentional biases to social scenes (happy, sad, and threatening) in ASD children. Method: An emotional dot-probe task was applied to children (from 6 to 12 years old) with Autism Spectrum Disorder without additional language and/or intellectual impairments (ASD; n=25) and age/sex-matched controls (n=25). Results: ASD children showed an attentional bias toward threatening scenes while typically developing children tended to direct their attention toward sad scenes. There were no differences between groups for happy scenes. Conclusions: Threatening situations captured greater attention in ASD individuals than in the control participants. Thus, abnormal attention to emotionally relevant situations may negatively affect the ability of ASD children to adapt cognitively and emotionally, particularly in threatening situations.

This bench study was designed to compare triggering and pressurization of 7 turbine mid-level ICU ventilators. METHODS: We used a dual-chamber lung model to test 7 mid-level ICU ventilators in pressure support mode with levels of 10, 15, and 20 cm H2O with 2 PEEP levels of 5 cm H2O and the minimum level allowed by the ventilator. A ventilator was connected to the master chamber to simulate 2 different effort levels. Pressure drop, trigger delay time, time to minimum pressure, and pressure time products (PTP) during trigger and the first 300 and 500 ms were analyzed. RESULTS: In the trigger evaluation, the Savina had the highest delay time, whereas the C2, the V60, and the Trilogy had the lowest pressure drops and PTP values in both effort levels. In pressurization capacity assessment using ideal PTP300 and PTP500 percentages, the C2 and the V680 had the best results, and the Carina and the Savina had lower values, with no differences between both effort levels. Differences between PEEP levels did not seem to be relevant. CONCLUSIONS: Pressure support mode for tested ventilators worked properly, but pressurization capacity and trigger function performance were clearly superior in the newest machines. The use of PEEP did not modify the results. (C) 2017 Daedalus Enterprises	[Delgado, Carlos; Puig, Jaume; Izquierdo, Ana; Ferrando, Carlos; Belda, F.

However, when considering the whole weight trajectories over time in the context of genome association analyses, it is important to look at the markers that affect growth curve parameters. The easiest way to consider them is via the two-step method, in which the growth curve parameters and marker effects are estimated separately, thereby resulting in a reduction of the statistical power and the precision of estimates. One efficient solution is to adopt nonlinear mixed models (NMM), which enables a joint modeling of the individual growth curves and marker effects. Our aim was to propose a genome association analysis for growth curves in pigs based on NMM as well as to compare it with the traditional two-step method. In addition, we also aimed to identify the nearest candidate genes related to significant SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) markers. The NMM presented a higher number of significant SNPs for adult weight (A) and maturity rate (K), and provided a direct way to test SNP significance simultaneously for both the A and K parameters. Furthermore, all significant SNPs from the two-step method were also reported in the NMM analysis. The ontology of the three candidate genes (SH3BGRL2, MAPK14, and MYL9) derived from significant SNPs (simultaneously affecting A and K) allows us to make inferences with regards to their contribution to the pig growth process in the population studied.

Over the last few years, several compounds have been studied to protect crops from pests, without displaying direct toxicity for pathogenic organisms. These compounds have the ability to induce a priming state on the plants that results in resistance (or tolerance) against subsequent infection by a pathogen. In terms of molecular response, induced plant defense involves a broad number of physical and biochemical changes such as callose deposition or phenolic compounds, activation of salicylic and/or jasrnonic acid pathways or synthesis of defense-related enzymes. Despite the large number of studies performed to ascertain the physiological and biochemical basis of induced resistance, only a few resistance-activating compounds have been studied as a real alternative to classic means of control and the studies geared towards incorporating induced resistance into disease management programs are relatively rare. The incorporation of natural resistance inducer in pest management programs of woody crops, alone or in combination with classical methods, could be a reliable method for reducing the amount of chemical residues in the environment. In this review, we discuss the current knowledge of induced resistance in woody crops, focusing on the mode of action of compounds authorized for conventional agriculture. We conclude by discussing the environmental and economic advantages of applying resistance inducers to conventional agriculture with special emphasis on natural compounds.

In this paper, we investigate the workflow scheduling problem in large-scale distributed systems, from the Quality of Service (QoS) and data locality perspectives. We present a scheduling approach, considering two models of synchronization for the tasks in a workflow application: (a) communication through the network and (b) communication through temporary files. Specifically, we investigate via simulation the performance of a heterogeneous distributed system, where multiple soft real-time workflow applications arrive dynamically. The applications are scheduled under various tardiness bounds, taking into account the communication cost in the first case study and the I/O cost and data locality in the second. The simulation results provide useful insights into the impact of tardiness, bound and data locality on the system performance. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

An Optical Atmospheric Phenomenon Observed in 1670 over the City of Astrakhan Was Not a Mid-Latitude Aurora	SOLAR PHYSICS			English	Article						Solar activity; Sunspots; Solar observations; Solar cycle	MAUNDER MINIMUM; SOLAR-ACTIVITY; SUNSPOT; CYCLE; DYNAMO; GRAND; RECORDS; NUMBERS; MAXIMA	It has recently been claimed (Zolotova and Ponyavin Solar Phys., 291, 2869, 2016; ZP16 henceforth) that a mid-latitude optical phenomenon, which took place over the city of Astrakhan in July 1670, according to Russian chronicles, were a strong aurora borealis. If this were true, it would imply a very strong or even severe geomagnetic storm during the quietest part of the Maunder minimum. However, as we argue in this article, this conclusion is erroneous and caused by a misinterpretation of the chronicle record. As a result of a thorough analysis of the chronicle text, we show that the described phenomenon occurred during the daylight period of the day ("the last morning hour"), in the south ("towards noon"), and its description does not match that of an aurora. The date of the event was also interpreted incorrectly. We conclude that this phenomenon was not a mid-latitude aurora, but an atmospheric phenomenon, the so-called sundog (or parhelion), which is a particular type of solar halo. Accordingly, the claim of a strong mid-latitude aurora during the deep Maunder Minimum is not correct and should be dismissed.	[Usoskin, I.

By focusing on the expanding tourism industry, second-home expansion, infrastructural development and sprawl around traditional rural centres, the paper assesses the effects of long-term economic, demographic, social and cultural transformations on rural landscapes in Alt Emporda, the so-called "Catalan Tuscany". The stratification of distinct urbanization waves and the underlying socio-economic processes observed in Alt Emporda reflect population dynamics and settlement morphologies typical of rural districts moving rapidly towards a suburban spatial organization. Recent urban dynamics in Mediterranean rural systems deserve further investigation in order to shed light on latent suburbanization processes involving marginal European regions.

In this study, we investigated the reactions of ozone with DON with a special emphasis on the formation of nitrate (NOT) and ammonium (NH4+). In batch ozonation experiments, the formation of NOT3- and NH4+ was investigated for natural organic matter standards, surface water, and wastewater effluent samples. A good correlation was found between NOT formation and the O-3 exposure (R-2 > 0.82) during ozonation of both model DON solutions and real water samples. To determine the main precursor of NON, solutions composed of tannic acid and model compounds with amine functional groups were ozonated. The NOT yield during, ozonation was significantly higher for glycine than for trimethylamine and dimethylamine. Experiments with glycine also showed that NOT was formed via an intermediate with a second-order rate constant of 7.7 +/- 0.1 M(-1)s(-1) while NH4+ was formed by an electron-transfer mechanism with O-3 as confirmed from a hydroxyl radical ((OH)-O-center dot) yield of 24.7 +/- 1.9%. The NH4+ concentrations, however, were lower than the OH yield (0.03 mol NH4+/mol center dot OH) suggesting other OH-producing reactions that compete with NH4+ formation. This study concludes that NOT formation during ozonation of DON is induced by an oxygen transfer to nitrogen forming hydroxylamine and oxime, while NH4+ formation is induced by electron transfer reactions involving C-centered radicals and imine intermediates.

Selective oxidation-induced strengthening of Zr/Nb nanoscale multilayers	ACTA MATERIALIA			English	Article						Multilayers; Strengthening; Oxidation; Size effects	INDIVIDUAL LAYER THICKNESS; MECHANICAL-BEHAVIOR; THERMAL-STABILITY; ZR; COMPOSITES; FILMS; MICROSTRUCTURE; RATIO	The paper presents a new approach, based on controlled oxidation of nanoscale metallic multilayers, to produce strong and hard oxide/metal nanocomposite coatings with high strength and good thermal stability. The approach is demonstrated by performing long term annealing on sputtered Zr/Nb nanoscale metallic multilayers and investigating the evolution of their microstructure and mechanical properties by combining analytical transmission electron microscopy, nano-mechanical tests and finite element models. As-deposited multilayers were annealed at 350 degrees C in air for times ranging between 1 and 336 h. The elastic modulus increased by similar to 20% and the hardness by similar to 42% after 15 h of annealing. Longer annealing times did not lead to changes in hardness, although the elastic modulus increased up to 35% after 336 h. The hcp Zr layers were rapidly transformed into monoclinic ZrO2 (in the first 15 h), while the Nb layers were progressively oxidised, from top surface down towards the substrate, to form an amorphous oxide phase at a much lower rate. The sequential oxidation of Zr and Nb layers was key for the oxidation to take place without rupture of the multi-layered structure and without coating spallation, as the plastic deformation of the metallic Nb layers allowed for the partial relieve of the residual stresses developed as a result of the volumetric expansion of the Zr layers upon oxidation. Moreover, the development of residual stresses induced further changes in mechanical properties in relation to the annealing time, as revealed by finite element simulations.

Influence of grain boundaries on the radiation-induced defects and hydrogen in nanostructured and coarse-grained tungsten	ACTA MATERIALIA			English	Article						Tungsten; Hydrogen; Monte Carlo simulation; Nanocrystalline; Irradiation effect	MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS SIMULATION; AUGMENTED-WAVE METHOD; DAMAGE; DIFFUSION; ENERGY; GOLD; RETENTION; VACANCIES; DENSITY; METALS	We have studied the influence of grain boundaries (GBs) on the radiation-induced defect evolution and on H retention at 300 K, both experimentally and by computer simulations. For this purpose, coarse grained tungsten (CGW) and nanostructured tungsten (NW) samples were implanted with H and C ions at energies of 170 keV and 665 keV respectively. Three different sets of experiments were carried out: (i) H single implantation, (ii) C and H co-implantation and (iii) C and H sequential implantation. Computer simulations were performed by using the Object Kinetic Monte Carlo (OKMC) methodology, which was parameterized by new and pre-existing Density Functional Theory (DFT) data. The three sets of experiments were simulated in monocrystalline tungsten (MW) and NW, resulting that (i) GBs have a clear influence on the amount and distribution of vacancies, being the vacancy concentration larger in NW than in MW samples, (ii) H retention is highly influenced by both the GBs themselves and the vacancy concentration, (iii) the size of HnVm clusters is slightly influenced by the presence of GBs and (iv) it can be inferred, from the comparison between experimental and computational results, that GBs act as preferential paths for H diffusion.

Rufinamide in children and adults in routine clinical practice	ACTA NEUROLOGICA SCANDINAVICA			English	Article						Resistant epilepsy; focal epilepsy; generalized epilepsy; rufinamide; childhood; adulthood	LENNOX-GASTAUT-SYNDROME; OPEN-LABEL; SEIZURES; EPILEPSY	Objective - To explore the long-term effectiveness of rufinamide in managing Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS), other epileptic encephalopathies, and intractable focal epilepsies in adults and children in routine clinical practice. Methods - A multicentre, retrospective chart review of patients prescribed adjunctive rufinamide at seven Spanish epilepsy centres, with assessments at six and 12 months. Results - We evaluated data from 58 patients (40 male, age range 7-57 years), 25 of whom were diagnosed with LGS, 12 with other epileptic encephalopathies and 21 of whom were diagnosed with focal epilepsies, mainly frontal lobe. The mean daily rufinamide dose was 32.0 mg/kg (range 12.5-66.7 mg/kg) in children and 24.7 mg/kg (range 5.0-47.0 mg/kg) in adults, and the most commonly used concomitant antiepileptic drugs were levetiracetam and valproate. Rufinamide was discontinued in 25 patients (43.1%) during the 1-year follow-up, and the most common reason was lack of effectiveness (n = 12, 20.7% of total). The frequency of generalized tonic-clonic seizures was significantly reduced from baseline at 6 and 12 months (P = 0.001), both in patients with generalized epilepsies and in patients with focal epilepsies. Significant seizure frequency reduction from baseline was observed at 12 months (P = 0.01) for tonic/atonic seizures and at 6 months (P = 0.001) for focal seizures. Side effects were reported in 21 patients (36.2%): nausea, vomiting and weight loss were most frequent. Conclusions - Rufinamide was well tolerated and was effective in reducing frequency of generalized tonic-clonic, tonic/atonic and focal seizures in both children and adults with severe refractory epilepsies, primarily LGS.

J	Carbonell, X; Panova, T				Carbonell, Xavier; Panova, Tayana			A critical consideration of social networking sites' addiction potential	ADDICTION RESEARCH & THEORY			English	Review						Social networking; addiction; Facebook; technology; behavioral addiction; online	PROBLEMATIC INTERNET USE; OVERPATHOLOGIZING EVERYDAY LIFE; COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL MODEL; ROLE-PLAYING GAMES; FACEBOOK ADDICTION; SELF-ESTEEM; PSYCHOLOGICAL PREDICTORS; SPONTANEOUS REMISSION; TENABLE BLUEPRINT; GAMING DISORDER	The evolution of the Internet and its applications has led to a notable increase in concern about social networking sites (SNSs). SNSs have had global mass appeal and their often frequent use - usually by young people - has triggered worries, discussions and studies on the topic of technological and social networking addictions. In addressing this issue, we have to ask to what extent technological and social networking addictions are of the same nature as substance addictions, and whether the consequences they lead to, if any, are severe enough to merit clinical attention. We can summarize our position on the topic by saying that SNSs are primarily used to increase social capital and that there is not currently enough empirical evidence on SNSs' addiction potential to claim that SNS addition exists. Although SNSs can provoke certain negative consequences in a subset of their users or provide a platform for the expression of preexisting conditions, this is not sufficient support for their standalone addictive power. It is necessary to distinguish between true addictive disorders, the kind that fall under the category of substance addictions, and the negative side-effects of engaging with certain appealing activities like SNSs so that we do not undermine the severity of psychiatric disorders and the experience of the individuals suffering from them. We propose that psychoeducation, viewing SNS use in context to understand their gratifications and compensatory functions and revisiting the terminology on the subject are sufficient to address the problems that emerge from SNS usage.

The Endoscopic Reference Score shows modest accuracy to predict either clinical or histological activity in adult patients with eosinophilic oesophagitis	ALIMENTARY PHARMACOLOGY & THERAPEUTICS			English	Article							PLACEBO-CONTROLLED TRIAL; ORAL VISCOUS BUDESONIDE; PROTON PUMP INHIBITOR; SWALLOWED FLUTICASONE; WHITE; RELIABILITY; DIAGNOSIS; CHILDREN; THERAPY	Background Conflicting results have been recently reported for the accuracy of the Endoscopic Reference Score (EREFS), an standardised endoscopic classification, to predict the histological activity of eosinophilic oesophagitis (EoE). Aim To evaluate the accuracy of the EREFS to predict either histological or clinical activity of EoE. Methods Prospective multicentre study conducted in eight Spanish centres evaluating adult EoE patients, either naive or after treatment. Symptoms were evaluated before upper endoscopy through the Dysphagia Symptom Score, whereas researchers scored the EREFS immediately after the endoscopic procedure, unaware of the histological outcome. Results One hundred and forty-five EoE patients undergoing 240 consecutive endoscopic procedures were included. Exudates (P = 0.03), furrows (P = 0.03) and a composite score of inflammatory signs (exudates, furrows and oedema) (P < 0.001) accurately predicted histological activity. Exudates were the only endoscopic sign showing a good correlation with histological outcome after therapy. Furrows and oedema persisted in 50% and 70% of patients despite histological remission. No endoscopic feature exceeded 70% accuracy to predict histological activity. Likewise, no endoscopic finding could adequately predict dysphagia severity. Crepe paper mucosa, diffuse exudates and severe rings correlated with higher symptom scores. Conclusions Endoscopic findings assessed by the Endoscopic Reference Score did not correlate with histological or clinical disease activity in adult EoE patients. Only exudates correlated with peak eosinophil count and histological outcome, whereas furrows and oedema persisted in over half of patients despite histological remission.

Improvement in liver histology due to lifestyle modification is independently associated with improved kidney function in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis	ALIMENTARY PHARMACOLOGY & THERAPEUTICS			English	Article							GLOMERULAR-FILTRATION-RATE; RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; FATTY LIVER; WEIGHT-LOSS; RENAL-DISEASE; CARDIOVASCULAR-DISEASE; METABOLIC SYNDROME; MORTALITY; FIBROSIS; EQUATION	Background Several recent studies have shown a strong association between non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and chronic kidney disease. Aim To examine the relationship between changes in liver histology and renal function in patients with NASH. Methods The present analysis represents a post hoc analysis of a recently published trial that included 261 patients with NASH who were treated with lifestyle modifications during 52 weeks. Kidney function was evaluated through Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFR, mL/min/1.73 m(2)) overtime. We explored correlations between the kidney function and improvement in histological outcomes at 52 weeks. Results Interestingly, a one-stage reduction in fibrosis (r = 0.20, P < 0.01) and resolution of NASH (r = 0.17, P < 0.01) were significantly correlated with an improvement in the kidney function. The eGFR values significantly increased in patients with fibrosis improvement (+7.6 +/- 6.5 mL/min/1.73 m(2)), compared to those without fibrosis improvement (-1.98 +/- 6.4 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) (P < 0.01) at end of treatment (EOT). Likewise, NASH resolution was associated with an increase in eGFR compared with patients without NASH resolution (2.32 +/- 7.8 mL/min/1.73 m(2) vs. -1.04 +/- 5.9 mL/min/1.73 m(2), P = 0.04) at EOT. After controlling for the confounders, the association between fibrosis improvement, NASH resolution and eGFR change remained significant (P < 0.05 for both). Conclusions Improvement in liver histology due to lifestyle modification is independently associated with improved kidney function in NASH. As new drugs for NASH emerge, studies should address whether improvement in histology in response to pharmacotherapies yield the same improvement in kidney function as weight loss.

Forage intake, digestibility and performance of cattle, horses, sheep and goats grazing together on an improved heathland	ANIMAL PRODUCTION SCIENCE			English	Article						beef; digestive capacity; equine; ingestive behaviour; meat production; mixed grazing	GORSE VEGETATION COMMUNITIES; ESTIMATE DIET SELECTION; IMPROVED PASTURE AREAS; HERBAGE INTAKE; ALKANE TECHNIQUE; INGESTIVE BEHAVIOR; SUCKLER COWS; RUMINANTS; DIGESTION; EXTRACTION	A mixed herd of five cows, five mares, 32 ewes and 32 goats was managed with their offspring during two consecutive years in a paddock (22.3 ha) with 76% of heathlands and 24% of improved pasture area, with the aim of studying their differences in ingestive behaviour and performance. Diet composition, dry matter intake (DMI) and digestibility (DMD) were estimated on three occasions using the alkane technique, and all animals were periodically weighed to calculate bodyweight (BW) changes per livestock unit (LU). Goats selected higher proportions of shrubs than the other herbivore species (P < 0.001). Overall, daily DMI was higher (P < 0.001) in equines (218 g/kg BW0.75) than in ruminants (174, 121 and 80 g/kg BW0.75 for cattle, goats and sheep, respectively), whereas DMD was lower (P < 0.001) in equines (569 g/kg DM) compared with ruminants (733-791 g/kg DM). During the first half of the grazing season (from late April to mid-July), dams' BW changes per LU did not differ between species. However, during late summer-autumn lower (P < 0.001) BW losses per LU were observed in sheep and goats (-89 g/day) than in cattle (-534 g/day), being intermediate in horses (-254 g/day). For the overall grazing season, ewes and goats showed greater (P = 0.056) BW gains per LU (338 g/day) than cows and mares (178 g/day). Regarding the offspring, BW gains per LU were greater (P < 0.001) in lambs (3612 g/day) than in other species. Calves presented greater gains than kids (2647 vs 1909 g/day.LU), whereas foals showed intermediate gains (2385 g/day.LU). Therefore, under these conditions of partially improved heathlands, sheep was the most productive species. However, looking at the diet selection and digestibility, goats could complement sheep or cattle herds by achieving a more efficient utilisation of heathland vegetation, and increasing overall productivity per hectare. By contrast, horses, having high levels of grass intake, compete with cattle and sheep for pasture utilisation.

These include (1) the trochlea for the extraocular obliquus superior muscle, (2) the pterygoid hamulus for the tensor veli palatini muscle, (3) the deep sulcus on the plantar aspect of the cuboid bone for the peroneus longus tendon, (4) the lesser sciatic notch for the obturator internus muscle, and (5) the bony trochleariformis process for the tensor tympani muscle tendon. In addition, (6) the stapedius muscle tendon shows a lesser or greater angulation at the pyramidal eminence of the temporal bone. Our recent studies have shown that the development of pulleys Nos. 1 and 2 can be explained by a change in the topographical relationship between the pulley and the tendon, that of pulley No. 3 by the rapidly growing calcaneus pushing the tendon, and that of pulley No. 4 by migration of the insertion along the sciatic nerve and gluteus medius tendon. Therefore, in Nos. 1-4, an initially direct tendon curves secondarily and obtains an attachment to the pulley. In case No. 6, the terminal part of the " stapedius tendon originates secondarily from the interzone mesenchymal tissue of the incudostapedial joint. In the case of pulley No. 5, we newly demonstrated that its initial phase of development was similar to No. 6, but the tensor tympani tendon achieved a right-angled turn under guidance by a specific fibrous tissue and it migrated along the growing malleus manubrium.

Mandibular second premolars (P2) and first molars (M1) were extracted from six Beagle dogs. P2 were categorized as small defects (SD) and M1 as large defects (LD). Four random groups were created: SC (small control defects with MP3 (R)), ST (small test defects MP3 (R) + pamidronate), LC (large control defects with MP3 (R)), and LT (large test defects MP3 (R) + pamidronate). At four and eight weeks of healing the samples were evaluated fisically through scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and chemical element mapping was carried out by Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). After four weeks of healing, SEM and EDX analysis revealed more mineralized bone in ST and LT groups compared with control groups (p < 0.05). After eight weeks, Ca/P ratios were slightly higher for small defects (groups SC and ST); in SEM description, in both control and test groups, trabecular bone density was similar to the adjacent mineralized cortical bone. Within the limitations of this experimental study, SEM description and EDX elemental microanalysis have demonstrated to be useful techniques to assess bone remodelling of small and large defects. Both techniques show increased bone formation in test groups (MP3 (R) modified with pamidronate) after four and eight weeks of healing. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

At the same time, surfactant constitutes the first line of lung defense against pathogens. This review presents an updated view on the processes involved in biogenesis and intracellular processing of newly synthesized and recycled surfactant components, as well as on the extracellular surfactant transformations before and after the formation of the surface active film at the air-water interface. Special attention is paid to the crucial regulation of surfactant homeostasis, because its disruption is associated with several lung pathologies. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

However, the potential interactions between the two treatments are only partially known. Our study was conducted on a degraded soil located in SW Spain, in order to assess if the combination of Ca-amendment plus crop-tillage provides long term soil amelioration on microbial activity. To this end the effects of four different combinations of Ca-amendment and crop-tillage on selected key soil microbial properties were analyzed. The experimental design was a split-plot with four replicates. The main factor was the application or not of a Ca-amendment, sugar foam (SF) and control (C), and the second factor was crop-tillage, no tilled improved pasture (no tilled-IP) and conventional tillage forage crop (tilled-FC). Soil samples were collected from 2 soil depths after 7 years since the first SF application and after 1 year from a repeated SF application. The use of the Ca-amendment meant a higher pH although this effect was not found in the combination Ca-amendment plus no-tilled. Total organic carbon (TOC) was highly influenced by tillage, being higher for no tilled plots. The interaction found between tillage and amendment suggested that the beneficial effect of the Ca-amendment on organic carbon is lost after tillage practices. A positive effect on microbial biomass carbon (MBC) was found after a second SF application for the no tilled plots in the upper layer however the effect was opposite in the deepest layer where no differences in TOC were found. After a year from a repeated SF application, a clear positive effect of no-tilled was observed on b-glucosidase, b-glucosaminidase and urease activities at the superficial layer. This fact was not found in these enzymatic activities when the amendment application effect was studied but an interaction between tillage and amendment showed that the Ca-amendment plus no-tilled combination was the most favorable option to increase the activities of these enzymes. Values of dehydrogenase were higher in amended plots than in control for both soil depths regardless of the sampling date, showing a pH effect on its activity. From our findings, no tillage plus a Ca-amendment appears to be the most suitable choice for ensuring suitable production, through the accumulation of soil organic matter (SOM) and the improvement of biological properties.

The AMT has mainly been used in adult populations, but its use in preschool children is less common. The need to create an appropriate instrument to study the memory specificity in preschool years led us to develop an AMT version adapted for early childhood. The AMT-Preschool (AMT-P) was administered to a sample of preschool children aged between 3 and 6 (N = 364). The results suggest that the AMT-P functions differently in preschoolers depending on age. With children older than 53 months, results suggest that the AMT-P is appropriate for assessing overgenerality. Nevertheless, with younger children age, the task is more difficult. These results concur with previous research suggesting that the ability to recall specific memories is consolidated from the age of 41/2.

Solar and thermal radiative effects during the 2011 extreme desert dust episode over Portugal	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Dust; Aerosol vertical profiles; EARLINET; AERONET; Forcing	URBAN COASTAL SITE; SAHARAN DUST; IBERIAN PENINSULA; SCATTERING PROPERTIES; AEROSOL PROPERTIES; OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; SURFACE; SPAIN; LIDAR; REGION	This paper analyses the influence of the extreme Saharan desert dust (DD) event on shortwave (SW) and longwave (LW) radiation at the EARLINET/AERONET Evora station (Southern Portugal) from 4 up to 7 April 2011. There was also some cloud occurrence in the period. In this context, it is essential to quantify the effect of cloud presence on aerosol radiative forcing. A radiative transfer model was initialized with aerosol optical properties, cloud vertical properties and meteorological atmospheric vertical profiles. The intercomparison between the instantaneous TOA shortwave and longwave fluxes derived using CERES and those calculated Using SBDART, which was fed with aerosol extinction coefficients derived from the CALIPSO and lidar-PAOLI observations, varying OPAC dataset parameters, was reasonably acceptable within the standard deviations. The dust aerosol type that yields the best fit was found to be the mineral accumulation mode. Therefore, SBDART model constrained with the CERES observations can be used to reliably determine aerosol radiative forcing and heating rates. Aerosol radiative forcings and heating rates were derived in the SW (ARF(sw), AHR(Sw)) and LW (ARF(Lw), AHR(Lw)) spectral ranges, considering a cloud-aerosol free reference atmosphere. We found that AOD at 440 nm increased by a factor of 5 on 6 April with respect to the lower dust load on 4 April. It was responsible by a strong cooling radiative effect pointed out by the ARF(sw) value (-99 W/m(2) for a solar zenith angle of 60 degrees) offset by a warming radiative effect according to ARF(Lw) value (+21.9 W/m(2)) at the surface. Overall, about 24% and 12% of the dust solar radiative cooling effect is compensated by its longwave warming effect at the surface and at the top of the atmosphere, respectively. Hence, larger aerosol loads could enhance the response between the absorption and re-emission processes increasing the ARF(Lw) with respect to those associated with moderate and low aerosol loads. The unprecedented results derived from this work complement the findings in other regions on the modifications of radiative energy budget by the dust aerosols, which could have relevant influences on the regional climate and will be topics for future investigations.

The impact of dust inputs on oceanic carbon uptake and climate is dependent on total dust deposition fluxes as well as the bioavailability of nutrients and metals in the dust. In this work, the solubility of trace metals (Fe, Al, Mn, Co and Cu) and ions (Ca, sulphate, nitrate and phosphate) has been estimated from the analysis of a long-time series of 109 samples collected over a 3-year period in the Canary Islands. Solubility is primarily a function of aerosol origin, with higher solubility values corresponding to aerosols with more anthropogenic influence. Using soluble fractions of trace elements measured in this work, atmospheric deposition fluxes of soluble metals and nutrients have been calculated. Inputs of dissolved nutrients (P, N and Fe) have been estimated for the mixed layer. Considering that P is the limiting factor when ratios of these elements are compared with phytoplankton requirements, an increase of 0.58 nM of P in the mixed layer (similar to 150 m depth) and in a year can be estimated, which can support an increase of 0.02 mu g Chla L-1 y(-1). These atmospheric inputs of trace metals and nutrients appear to be significant relative to the concentrations reported in this region, especially during the summer months when the water column is more stratified and deep-water nutrient inputs are reduced.

We report on the oxidative potential (OP) of PM2.5 samples collected in the Barcelona subway system in different types of stations. The PM chemical composition of these samples showed typically high concentrations of Fe, Total Carbon, Ba, Cu, Mn, Zn and Cr sourced from rail tracks, wheels, catenaries, brake pads and pantographs. Two toxicological indicators of oxidative activity, ascorbic acid (AA) oxidation (expressed as OPAA mu g(-1) or OPAA m(-3)) and glutathione (GSH) oxidation (expressed as OPGSH mu g(-1) or OPGSH m(-3)), showed low OP for all samples (compared with outdoor air) but considerable variation between stations (0.9-2.4 OPAA mu g(-1); 0.4-1.9 OPGSH mu g(-1)). Results indicate that subway PM toxicity is not related to variations in PM2.5 concentrations produced by ventilation changes, tunnel works, or station design, but may be affected more by the presence of metallic trace elements such as Cu and Sb sourced from brakes and pantographs. The OP assays employed do not reveal toxic effects from the highly ferruginous component present in subway dust. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This work invokes specific ethical concerns such as use of at-risk' language, communicating study findings to parents and the future perspective of enrolled infants when they reach adulthood. This study aimed to ground this research field in an understanding of the perspectives of members of the autism community. Following focus groups to identify topics, an online survey was distributed to autistic adults, parents of children with autism and practitioners in health and education settings across 11 European countries. Survey respondents (n=2317) were positively disposed towards early autism research, and there was significant overlap in their priorities for the field and preferred language to describe infant research participants. However, there were also differences including overall less favourable endorsement of early autism research by autistic adults relative to other groups and a dislike of the phrase at-risk' to describe infant participants, in all groups except healthcare practitioners. The findings overall indicate that the autism community in Europe is supportive of early autism research.

Studies of its virulence factors are therefore of great interest. Fungal ribotoxins are toxic ribonucleases with extraordinary efficiency against ribosomes and suggested as potential insecticides. Here we describe this ribotoxin characteristic activity in M. anisopliae cultures. Anisoplin has been obtained as a recombinant protein and further characterized. It is structurally similar to hirsutellin A, the ribotoxin from the entomopathogen Hirsutella thompsonii. Moreover, anisoplin shows the ribonucleolytic activity typical of ribotoxins and cytotoxicity against insect cells. How Metarhizium uses this toxin and possible applications are of interest.

Magnetic hyperthermia enhances cell toxicity with respect to exogenous heating	BIOMATERIALS			English	Article						Magnetic nanoparticles; Magnetic hyperthermia; Human neuroblastoma; Specific power absorption; Cell viability	INTRACELLULAR HYPERTHERMIA; NANOPARTICLES; CANCER; THERAPY; SH-SY5Y; TUMORS	Magnetic hyperthermia is a new type of cancer treatment designed for overcoming resistance to chemotherapy during the treatment of solid, inaccessible human tumors. The main challenge of this technology is increasing the local tumoral temperature with minimal side effects on the surrounding healthy tissue. This work consists of an in vitro study that compared the effect of hyperthermia in response to the application of exogenous heating (EHT) sources with the corresponding effect produced by magnetic hyperthermia (MHT) at the same target temperatures. Human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were loaded with magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) and packed into dense pellets to generate an environment that is crudely similar to that expected in solid micro-tumors, and the above-mentioned protocols were applied to these cells. These experiments showed that for the same target temperatures, MHT induces a decrease in cell viability that is larger than the corresponding EHT, up to a maximum difference of approximately 45% at T = 46 degrees C. An analysis of the data in terms of temperature efficiency demonstrated that MHT requires an average temperature that is 6 degrees C lower than that required with EHT to produce a similar cytotoxic effect. An analysis of electron microscopy images of the cells after the EHT and MHT treatments indicated that the enhanced effectiveness observed with MHT is associated with local cell destruction triggered by the magnetic nano-heaters. The present study is an essential step toward the development of innovative adjuvant anti-cancer therapies based on local hyperthermia treatments using magnetic particles as nano-heaters.

Animal models of acute SCI have provided evidence that transplantation of ependymal stem/progenitor cells of the spinal cord (epSPCs) induces functional recovery, while systemic administration of the anti-inflammatory curcumin provides neuroprotection. However, functional recovery from chronic stage SCI requires additional enhancements in available therapeutic strategies. Herein, we report on a combination treatment for SCI using epSPCs and a pH-responsive polymer-curcumin conjugate. The incorporation of curcumin in a pH-responsive polymeric carrier mainchain, a polyacetal (PA), enhances blood bioavailability, stability, and provides a means for highly localized delivery. We find that PA-curcumin enhances neuroprotection, increases axonal growth, and can improve functional recovery in acute SCI. However, when combined with epSPCs, PA-curcumin also enhances functional recovery in a rodent model of chronic SCI. This suggests that combination therapy may be an exciting new therapeutic option for the treatment of chronic SCI in humans. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Active and passive immunotherapy may limit cerebral A beta deposition and/or accelerate its clearance. With the aid of a newly characterized monoclonal anti-A beta antibody we constructed immunoPEGliposomes with high avidity for capturing A beta in the periphery. The functionality of these vesicles in modulating A beta uptake by both human brain capillary endothelial hCMEC/D3 cells (suppressing uptake) and THP-1 phagocytes (stimulating uptake) was confirmed in vitro. The multivalent immunoliposomes dramatically reduced circulating and brain levels of A beta(1-40), and particularly A beta(1-42), in "aged" (16 month-old), but not "adult" (10 month-old) APP/PS1 transgenic mice on repeated intraperitoneal administration. Furthermore, the immunoPEGliposome-mediated reduction in amyloidosis correlated with lower levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and reactive glia (GFAP-positive cells). This treatment also lowered the ratio of phosphorylated Tau to total Tau. The therapeutic efficacy of immunoliposome treatment was superior to free monoclonal antibody administration (at an equivalent antibody dose). The potential mechanisms and significance of age-dependent immunoliposome therapy in AD is discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The uptake of PMo12 on carbon supports follows a clear correlation with the micropore volume, which implies that PMo12 is mainly adsorbed in microporosity as a consequence of a greater confinement in this kind of pores instead of mesopores. Transmission electron microscopy indicates that the PMo12 adsorbed is homogeneously dispersed in the carbon texture. Finally, the addition of PMo12 to the original carbon electrodes provided capacitances up to 293 F per gram of electrode, substantially larger than the 206-240 F g(-1) of the unmodified activated carbon. This result represented an increase of up to 35% in terms of gravimetric energy density and 160% in terms of volumetric energy density, after PMo12 integration into the carbon matrix.

Development of highly efficient Cu versus Pd catalysts supported on graphitic carbon materials for the reduction of 4-nitrophenol to 4-aminophenol at room temperature	CARBON			English	Article							AROMATIC NITRO-COMPOUNDS; CHEMOSELECTIVE HYDROGENATION; COPPER NANOPARTICLES; NI NANOPARTICLES; AQUEOUS-SOLUTION; FACILE SYNTHESIS; GREEN SYNTHESIS; MODEL REACTION; GRAPHENE; OXIDE	In this work we report a simple procedure for synthesis of Cu and Pd catalysts supported on high surface area graphite (HSAG) by wetness impregnation technique, and further generation of metal nanoparticles using NaBH4 as reducing agent. The catalysts have been tested in the reduction of 4-nitrophenol to 4-aminophenol, at room temperature, in presence of NaBH4 as hydrogen source. Both Cu and Pd catalysts exhibited exceptionally high catalytic activity with the total degradation of 4-nitrophenol in less than 45 s. Taking into account that Cu is cheaper than Pd, we focused our investigation on studying the catalytic properties of Cu nanoparticles supported over two lab prepared graphene-materials (one N-doped and other undoped) and the commercial HSAG. The maximum catalytic activity was obtained with Cu supported on undoped graphene due to the combination of two parameters: small metal particle size and the unique properties of graphene generated by its electron transference ability. However, recyclability of both Cu/graphene-materials fell after 5 consecutive runs, while Cu/HSAG displayed high stability even after 10 cycles.

The PSU polymer is bonded to rGO at the extremity (rGO-PSU end) and at the middle of the PSU chain (rGO-PSU mid). The resulting rGO-PSU synthetic products are carefully characterized by Raman and FTIR spectroscopy, XPS, TEM, and thermogravimetric analysis, evidencing the successful grafting of PSU onto rGO surfaces. The long-term stability of these nanosheets is also determined in common solvents. The antibacterial properties of polymer-functionalized rGO against the planktonic Bacilus subtilis and Escherichia coli are also investigated. It is established that the antimicrobial properties of these nanocomposites are due to the production of reactive oxygen species. The results also demonstrate that rGO-PSU mid presents better antimicrobial properties due to shorter polymer chains, which improves the contact of the microorganisms with the graphene surface.

A particular attention was accorded to the role of the chemical composition and the nature of the amorphous carbon matrix on the electrical behavior of the material. The nc-Ni/C thin films were synthesized using two different cold plasma processes both allowing to finely control the chemical composition, structure and morphology of the films. The first process combines magnetron sputtering of a nickel target and the deposition of hydrogenated carbon by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition using methane as a precursor. The second process consists in the co-sputtering of a nickel and a graphite target in pure argon plasma. For the two deposition processes, a similar increase in the electrical conductivity with the Ni content was observed and attributed to the percolation of the Ni nanograins through the carbon matrix. The percolation threshold was evaluated around 41 at.% of Ni for the two deposition processes. For lower Ni concentrations, the microstructural study indicated that the electrical conductivity is governed by the nature of the amorphous carbon phase which is found to be dependent on the deposition process as revealed by mu-Raman spectroscopy.

Based on 35 in-depth interviews with adult men and women in Ecuador, a Latin American country, the authors sought to expand knowledge regarding one of these systems: clothing disposal by gifting to family, friends, and acquaintances. The respondents' narratives indicated that the clothing disposal system by gifting is noncentric; based on social exchange, it strengthens the links between givers and recipients while allowing for clothes to circulate for a longer time. The data also indicated an intersection between age and gender, offering insight into how the process of clothing disposal by gifting develops within households. In some disposal events reported by participants, the clothing disposal system by gifting demonstrated autonomy, but in other events, it interacted with the clothing marketing system.

In particular, the existence of a random attractor is proved for the random model and the persistence of the disease is analyzed as well. In the stochastic case, we consider some environmental effect on the model, in fact, we assume that one of the coefficients of the system is affected by some stochastic perturbation, and analyze the asymptotic behavior of the solutions. The paper is concluded with a comparison between the two different modeling strategies.

The current study investigated hair cortisol concentrations in female victims of IPV and their children. Methods: A total of 52 mother child dyads were divided into two groups depending on exposure to IPV: IPV group (n = 27 dyads) and control group (n = 25 dyads). Hair cortisol concentration was measured in 1-cm-long hair strands, representing 30 days of exposure before assessment. PTSD and depression symptoms were assessed in the mother and child. Results: Women reporting IPV presented with higher hair cortisol levels, depression and PTSD symptoms severity in comparison to control women. Children who witnessed IPV reported more severe PTSD symptoms, but depressive symptoms and hair cortisol were not statistically different than those in control children. Correlation analyses revealed a positive association between the number of injury events and the level of hair cortisol in children. No associations between the hair cortisol levels in mothers and those in their children were found. Conclusion: Higher hair cortisol levels detected in women exposed to IPV reflected long-lasting changes in HPA axis functioning associated with chronic stress exposure. Children whose parents recurrently engage in violent conflicts with intimate partners may often feel threatened and consequently reporting more PTSD-related symptoms. Given that experiencing and witnessing violence during childhood and adolescence are predictive of intimate partner violence in adulthood, the need of early interventions is crucial.

The main objectives in the present study are: 1) to explore the role of sex and age on impulsivity levels in GD patients; 2) to identify the relationship of the different impulsivity facets with comorbid psychopathology and other personality traits in GD patients; and (3) to assess whether impulsivity is a predictor for the severity of GD. Method: The final sample consisted of 406 consecutive participants. All of them were seeking treatment for GD (88.4% male and 11.6% female) and completed the South Oaks Gambling Screen (SOGS), the UPPS-P Impulsive Behavior Scale, the Symptom Checklist (SCL-90-R), the Temperament and Character Inventory-R (TCI-R) as well as other clinical and psychopathological measures. Results: Results show a negative linear trend between age and lower sensation seeking levels as well as lack of premeditation (the higher the age the lower the UPPS-P scores), and a positive linear trend between age and positive urgency (UR) (the higher the age the higher the UPPS-P score). However, no sex differences were found for the assessed impulsivity dimensions. Lack of perseverance was positively associated with obsessive compulsive symptoms and harm avoidance trait, and negatively related to persistence and self-directedness traits. Positive UR and negative UR were positively correlated with general psychopathology and the total number of DSM-IV criteria, and negatively associated to the following personality traits: self-directedness and cooperativeness. Finally, only the sensation seeking and negative UR of the UPPS-P showed predictive capacity on the severity of the disorder (the higher the impulsivity scores the higher the illness severity). Conclusions: These findings highlight the association between impulsivity traits (measured by the UPPS-P) and GD in a large and consecutively recruited clinical sample with GD, taking into account the variables sex and age.

Still, those differences can only be portrayed accurately by means of studies that derive information from multiple sources. One such study was performed in a well-defined area supported by a Mental Health Clinical Management Unit in Malaga, Spain. Methods: Data from 1640 patients (1048 men and 592 women) that were in contact with services during 2008 were examined for the purpose of the present analysis. Gender differences in sociodemographic and clinical characteristics and the role of gender for explaining clinical characteristics (diagnosis, disease severity and service use) beyond potential sociodemographic confounders were explored. Results: The chi-squared analysis results revealed that in comparison to men, women were older, married or widowed/divorced and living as housewives with their families in cities. Genders also differed across diagnoses, with men being at higher risk for suffering from paranoid schizophrenia, while women being at higher risk for persistent delusional, acute/transitory and schizoaffective disorders. Furthermore, men had greater disease severity and higher chances to visit the mental health rehabilitation unit (MHRU). Further regression analyses revealed that after controlling for confounders, gender differences remained significant across diagnoses and severity. However, they lost their significance under the influence of marital, living and occupational status when predicting the use of MHRU. Conclusion: Results confirm the existence of gender differences and highlight the importance of other factors for designing effective psychosocial services that are tailor-made to the patients' needs.

The Eulerian wall film approach is proposed to simulate airway mucus flow during a cough. The reproduced airway domain is based on realistic geometry from the literature and captures the deformation of flexible tissue. To quantify the overall performance of this complex phenomenon, cough efficiency (CE) was calculated, which provided an easily reproducible measurement parameter for the cough clearance process. Moreover, the effect of mucus layer thickness was examined. The relationship between the CE and the mucus viscosity was quantified using reductions from 20 to 80%. Finally, predictions of CE values based on healthy person inputs were compared with values obtained from patients with different respiratory diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and respiratory muscle weakness (RMW). It was observed that CE was reduced by 50% in patients with COPD compared with that of a healthy person. On average, CE was reduced in patients with RMW to 10% of the average value of a healthy person.

The procedure consists of defining the value of the preconsolidation stress (the hardening parameter of a Cam-Clay model) so that the drift of the yield surface is zero at each calculation step. The results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed procedure, especially along softening paths. The method can easily be implemented in existing explicit integration modules, which facilitates its practical application. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The main objectives are: to estimate the strength parameters of the ground; to perform a sensitivity analysis on the back slope height and to obtain the shape and position of the failure surface. Because of uncertainty of the original strength parameters, a simplified backanalysis using a range of cohesion/friction pairs has been used to estimate the most realistic strength parameters. The analysis shows that failure occurred because overestimation of strength and underestimation of loads. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, few studies have addressed the effect of passion and impulsivity in garners. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to examine the influence of passion and impulsivity on the intensity of play, playing time, and choice of Massive Multiplayer Online Role Play Game (MMORPG) vs. non-MMORPG. A sample of 630 university students (40.7% Colombian, 59.3% Spanish) responded to a questionnaire on gaming habits, the Passion scale and the Inventory of Impulsivity. Results showed that men preferred sports and MMORPG games and women played more simulation and strategy games and mini-games. The predictor variables for Intensity of Play were: playing MMORPG games, harmonious and obsessive passion and dysfunctional impulsivity. The predictor variables for Hours of Play were: age, harmonious passion and dysfunctional impulsivity. Age, both passions, and functional impulsivity predicted preference for MMORPGs. Impulsivity and passion help explain how players engage with videogames. Dysfunctional impulsivity is related to higher hours and intensity of play and functional impulsivity is a defining feature of MMORPG players. The presence of both passions was related to a higher intensity of play, however only harmonious passion was positively associated with playing for a longer time. These results suggest that the different types of passion and impulsivity have distinct influences on the manner of game play and the experience of that play. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The next trend of innovations is likely to come from humans' ability to connect to machines and the data that comes from these connections. The IBM Intelligent Operation Center (IOC) is a "system of systems" that is not intended to replace an existing physical infrastructure that gathers raw data. Instead, it is intended to extract only the data necessary to optimize the operations of the organization. The types of data and integration into the IOC make efficient problem solving solutions readily available to city authorities. The user interface and standard operating procedure and the resource processing capabilities of the IOC indicate that this system is optimal for smart cities of the future with regard to improvement of quality of life and ease of navigation. The need for smart cities, universities, campuses, citizens, and students to drive growth of urban and regional economies is evident. In this article, a thorough analysis of the architectural design of an intelligent operational system is completed to present a smart solution for cities to unify departments and agencies under one umbrella.

The target group for this study was senior citizens in an adult day care centre. This group was selected for two reasons: firstly, for belonging to a generation that has not grown up surrounded by digital technologies; and secondly, for therefore being at a disadvantage when it comes to adopting and using modern day information and communication technologies. Research was focused on the potential benefits of digital technologies and also on how senior citizens responded towards them, in particular how they felt these technologies were improving their social and personal well-being. Digital technologies were introduced into the day-to-day lives of senior citizens, providing them with a variety of alternative ways to access social media, communication tools or cultural content. Using digital technologies, they were also asked to perform activities related to their own personal and social well-being. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this context, the major contributions of the present study are the examination of the sources and the consequences of users' satisfaction with digital technologies; as well as the proposal, development and empirical test of a conceptual model on digital satisfaction. For this purpose, and based on the Flow Experience Theory, the present study develops and empirically tests a conceptual model on the creation and the consequences of users' satisfaction with digital outlets. For this purpose, drawing on a sample of 750 consumers, we developed Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) analysis. This study found that users increase their satisfaction with digital technologies from the perceived ease of use and the content characteristics themselves; while loyalty, engagement and word of mouth are the main consequences of satisfaction. However, derived from our results we cannot report the influence of free access to a digital outlet on consumers' satisfaction. Finally, our findings would imply shifting resources to enhance users' engagement through the flow experience, by providing an easy use and an easy access to digital platforms. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Functional abolition of carotid body activity restores insulin action and glucose homeostasis in rats: key roles for visceral adipose tissue and the liver	DIABETOLOGIA			English	Article						Adipose tissue; Carotid sinus nerve; Glucose homeostasis; Insulin sensitivity; Liver	CHRONIC INTERMITTENT HYPOXIA; SINOAORTIC DENERVATED RATS; HYPERBARIC-OXYGEN THERAPY; HIGH-FAT; DIABETES-MELLITUS; ARTERIAL-PRESSURE; SKELETAL-MUSCLE; BLOOD-PRESSURE; IN-VIVO; RESISTANCE	We recently described that carotid body (CB) over-activation is involved in the aetiology of insulin resistance and arterial hypertension in animal models of the metabolic syndrome. Additionally, we have demonstrated that CB activity is increased in animal models of insulin resistance, and that carotid sinus nerve (CSN) resection prevents the development of insulin resistance and arterial hypertension induced by high-energy diets. Here, we tested whether the functional abolition of CB by CSN transection would reverse pre-established insulin resistance, dyslipidaemia, obesity, autonomic dysfunction and hypertension in animal models of the metabolic syndrome. The effect of CSN resection on insulin signalling pathways and tissue-specific glucose uptake was evaluated in skeletal muscle, adipose tissue and liver. Experiments were performed in male Wistar rats submitted to two high-energy diets: a high-fat diet, representing a model of insulin resistance, hypertension and obesity, and a high-sucrose diet, representing a lean model of insulin resistance and hypertension. Half of each group was submitted to chronic bilateral resection of the CSN. Age-matched control rats were also used. CSN resection normalised systemic sympathetic nervous system activity and reversed weight gain induced by high-energy diets. It also normalised plasma glucose and insulin levels, insulin sensitivity lipid profile, arterial pressure and endothelial function by improving glucose uptake by the liver and perienteric adipose tissue. We concluded that functional abolition of CB activity restores insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis by positively affecting insulin signalling pathways in visceral adipose tissue and liver.

Mitochondria-related transcriptional signature is downregulated in adipocytes in obesity: a study of young healthy MZ twins	DIABETOLOGIA			English	Article						Adipocytes; Gene expression; Mitochondria; Obesity; Twins	TUMOR-NECROSIS-FACTOR; HUMAN ADIPOSE-TISSUE; FAT-CELL SIZE; INSULIN-RESISTANCE; FACTOR-ALPHA; IN-VIVO; ACQUIRED OBESITY; EXPRESSION; MICE; BIOGENESIS	Low mitochondrial activity in adipose tissue is suggested to be an underlying factor in obesity and its metabolic complications. We aimed to find out whether mitochondrial measures are downregulated in obesity also in isolated adipocytes. We studied young adult monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs discordant (n = 14, intrapair difference Delta BMI >= 3 kg/m(2)) and concordant (n = 5, Delta BMI < 3 kg/m(2)) for BMI, identified from ten birth cohorts of 22- to 36-year-old Finnish twins. Abdominal body fat distribution (MRI), liver fat content (magnetic resonance spectroscopy), insulin sensitivity (OGTT), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, serum lipids and adipokines were measured. Subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue biopsies were obtained to analyse the transcriptomics patterns of the isolated adipocytes as well as of the whole adipose tissue. Mitochondrial DNA transcript levels in adipocytes were measured by quantitative real-time PCR. Western blots of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) protein levels in adipocytes were performed in obese and lean unrelated individuals. The heavier (BMI 29.9 +/- 1.0 kg/m(2)) co-twins of the discordant twin pairs had more subcutaneous, intra-abdominal and liver fat and were more insulin resistant (p < 0.01 for all measures) than the lighter (24.1 +/- 0.9 kg/m(2)) co-twins. Altogether, 2538 genes in adipocytes and 2135 in adipose tissue were significantly differentially expressed (nominal p < 0.05) between the co-twins. Pathway analysis of these transcripts in both isolated adipocytes and adipose tissue revealed that the heavier co-twins displayed reduced expression of genes relating to mitochondrial pathways, a result that was replicated when analysing the pathways behind the most consistently downregulated genes in the heavier co-twins (in at least 12 out of 14 pairs). Consistently upregulated genes in adipocytes were related to inflammation. We confirmed that mitochondrial DNA transcript levels (12S RNA, 16S RNA, COX1, ND5, CYTB), expression of mitochondrial ribosomal protein transcripts and a major mitochondrial regulator PGC-1 alpha (also known as PPARGC1A) were reduced in the heavier co-twins' adipocytes (p < 0.05). OXPHOS protein levels of complexes I and III in adipocytes were lower in obese than in lean individuals. Subcutaneous abdominal adipocytes in obesity show global expressional downregulation of oxidative pathways, mitochondrial transcripts and OXPHOS protein levels and upregulation of inflammatory pathways.

Fast Bayesian blind deconvolution with Huber Super Gaussian priors	DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Blind deconvolution; Image deblurring; Image restoration; Variational Bayesian	IMAGE; RESTORATION	Expectation Maximization (EM) based inference has already proven to be a very powerful tool to solve blind image deconvolution (BID) problems. Unfortunately, three important problems still impede the application of EM in BID: the undesirable saddle points and local minima caused by highly nonconvex priors, the instability around zero of some of the most interesting sparsity promoting priors, and the intrinsic high computational cost of the corresponding BID algorithm. In this paper we first show how Super Gaussian priors can be made numerically tractable around zero by introducing the family of Huber Super Gaussian priors and then present a fast EM based blind deconvolution method formulated in the image space. In the proposed computational approach, image and kernel estimation are performed by using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), which allows to exploit the advantages of FFT computation. For highly nonconvex priors, we propose a Smooth ADMM (SADMM) approach to avoid poor BID estimates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art BID methods in terms of quality of the reconstructions and speed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

We consider the application context of urban mobility, where several modalities of transport and different measurement devices can be employed. Therefore, we address the joint problem of online tracking and detection of the current modality. For this purpose, we use interacting parallel particle filters, each one addressing a different model. They cooperate for providing a global estimator of the variable of interest and, at the same time, an approximation of the posterior density of each model given the data. The interaction occurs by a parsimonious distribution of the computational effort, with online adaptation for the number of particles of each filter according to the posterior probability of the corresponding model. The resulting scheme is simple and flexible. We have tested the novel technique in different numerical experiments with artificial and real data, which confirm the robustness of the proposed scheme.

Effect of diet on carboxylesterase activity of tadpoles (Rhinella arenarum) exposed to chlorpyrifos	ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY			English	Article						Organophosphorus; Carboxylesterase; Acetylcholinesterase; Pesticide detoxification; Amphibians; Outdoor microcosm	IN-VITRO; CARBAMATE INSECTICIDES; ESTERASE-ACTIVITIES; ANURA HYLIDAE; B-ESTERASES; ORGANOPHOSPHORUS; ARGENTINA; PLASMA; TOXICITY; WATER	An outdoor microcosm was performed with tadpoles (Rhinella arenarum) exposed to 125 mu g L-1 chlorpyrifos and fed two types of food, i.e., lettuce (Lactuca sativa) and a formulated commercial pellet. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and carboxylesterase (CbE) activities were measured in liver and intestine after 10 days of pesticide exposure. Non-exposed tadpoles fed lettuce had an intestinal AChE activity almost two-fold higher than that of pellet-fed tadpoles. No significant differences were observed, however, in liver AChE activity between diets. Likewise, intestinal CbE activity measured using two substrates, i.e. 1-naphthyl acetate (1-NA) and 4-nitrophenyl valerate (4-NPV) was higher in tadpoles fed lettuce than in those fed pellets. However, the diet-dependent response of liver CbE activity was opposite to that in the intestine. Chlorpyrifos caused a significant inhibition of both esterase activities, which was tissue- and diet-specific. The highest inhibition degree was found in the intestinal AChE and CbE activities of lettuce-fed tadpoles (42-78% of controls) compared with pellet-fed tadpoles (< 60%). Although chlorpyrifos significantly inhibited liver CbE activity of the group fed lettuce, this effect was not observed in the group fed pellets. In general, intestinal CbE activity was more sensitive to chlorpyrifos inhibition than AChE activity. This finding, together with the high levels of basal CbE activity found in the intestine, may be understood as a detoxification system able to reduce intestinal OP uptake. Moreover, the results of this study suggest that diet is a determinant factor in toxicity testing with tadpoles to assess OP toxicity, because it modulates levels of this potential detoxifying enzyme activity.

Their presence in water bodies is due mainly to domestic, agricultural and industrial wastewater discharges and constitutes a hazard for the organisms inhabiting these environments. The present study aimed to evaluate geno- and cytotoxicity induced by Al, Fe, Hg and the mixture of these metals on blood of the common carp Cyprinus carpio. Specimens were exposed to the permissible limits in water for human use and consumption according to the pertinent official Mexican norm [official Mexican norm NOM-127-SSA1-1994] Al (0.2 mg L-1), Fe (0.3 mg L-1), Hg (0.001 mg L-1) and their mixture for 12, 24, 48, 72 and 96 h. Biomarkers of genotoxicity (comet assay and micronucleus test) and cytotoxicity (caspase-3 activity and TUNEL assay) were evaluated. Significant increases relative to the control group (p < 0.05) were observed in all biomarkers at all exposure times in all test systems; however, damage was greater when the metals were present as a mixture. Furthermore, correlations between metal concentrations and biomarkers of geno- and cytotoxicity were found only at certain exposure times. In conclusion, Al, Fe, Hg and the mixture of these metals induce geno- and cytotoxicity on blood of C carpio. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Due to its high lipophilicity and persistence in the aquatic ecosystems, TCC is of emerging environmental concern. Despite the frequently reported detection of TCC in the environment and significant uncertainties about its long term effects on aquatic ecosystems, few studies have addressed the chronic effects of TCC in aquatic organisms at ecologically relevant concentrations. Therefore, we aimed at testing a broad range of biological responses in the amphipod Gammarus locusta following a chronic (60 days) exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of TCC (100, 500 and 2500 ng/L). This work integrated biochemical markers of oxidative stress (catalase (CAT), glutathione-s-transferase (GST) and lipid peroxidation (LPO)) and neurotransmission (acetylcholinesterase (AChE)) with several key ecological endpoints, i.e. behaviour, survival, individual growth and reproduction. Significant alterations were observed in all biochemical markers. While AChE showed a dose-response curve (with a significant increased activity at a TCC concentration of 2500 ng/L), oxidative stress markers did not follow a dose-response curve, with significant increase at 100 and/or 500 ng/L and a decreased activity in the highest concentration (2500 ng/L). The same effect was observed in the females' behavioural response, whereas males' behaviour was not affected by TCC exposure. The present study represents a first approach to characterize the hazard of TCC to crustaceans.

J	Blanco, G; Junza, A; Barron, D				Blanco, Guillermo; Junza, Alexandra; Barron, Dolores			Food safety in scavenger conservation: Diet-associated exposure to livestock pharmaceuticals and opportunist mycoses in threatened Cinereous and Egyptian vultures	ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY			English	Article						Antibiotics; Avian scavengers; Conservation management; Disease; Vulture restaurants	KITES MILVUS-MIGRANS; AQUATIC ENVIRONMENT; AEGYPIUS-MONACHUS; GRIFFON VULTURES; CENTRAL SPAIN; GYPS-FULVUS; ANTIBIOTICS; QUINOLONES; TOXICITY; RESIDUES	Pharmaceuticals from veterinary treatments may enter terrestrial food webs when medicated livestock are available to wildlife in supplementary feeding stations aimed at the conservation of endangered scavengers. Here, we hypothesized that the exposure risk to livestock fluoroquinolones, as indicators of pharmaceutical burden in food, is related to the variable reliance of scavengers on domestic versus wild animal carcasses. Since the misuse of broad-spectrum antibiotics is a major predisposing factor for opportunistic mycoses, we evaluated disease signs potentially associated with diet-dependent drug exposure in nestlings of two threatened vultures. A greater occurrence (100%, n=14) and concentration of fluoroquinolones (mean +/- SD=73.0 +/- 27.5 mu g L-1, range=33.2-132.7), mostly enrofloxacin, were found in Cinereous vultures, Aegypius monachus, due to their greater dependence on livestock carcasses than Egyptian vultures, Neophron percnopterus (fluoroquinolones occurrence: 44%, n=16, concentration: 37.9 +/- 16.6 mu g L-1, range=11.5-55.9), which rely much more on carcasses of wild animals (42% of remains vs. 23% in the cinereous vulture). The chaotic, chronic and pulsed ingestion of these drugs throughout nestling development is proposed as one of the most plausible explanations for the high occurrence and intensity of oral Candida-like lesions in nestling vultures. The high occurrence of fluoroquinolone residues and disease hindered the probing of a cause-effect relationship between both factors in individual vultures. This relationship could be evaluated through a population-based approach by sampling vultures not exposed to these drugs. The high dependence of vultures on domestic animals today compared to past decades and the growing intensification of livestock farming, imply an expected increase in the impact of pharmaceuticals on scavenger populations. This requires further evaluation due to potential consequences in biodiversity conservation and environmental health. We encourage the prioritization of efforts to promote the use of less medicated free-ranging livestock carcasses left in the countryside, rather than stabled stocks made available in vulture restaurants. Additionally, attention should be paid to the population recovery of wild species that dominated scavenger diets in the past.

Two MFCs were operated in semicontinuous mode, using winery wastewater as fuel, activated sludge as the anodic inoculum, and concentrations of 0.05 and 0.25 M of ferrocyanide added in the cathode chamber as redox mediators. The MFC used had two chambers separated by a proton exchange membrane SterionA (R). The results show that permeability of the membrane to mediators is a factor of the major significance. Under no crossover, the mediator produced a positive effect on the electricity generation and COD removal. However, as the experiments progressed, a significant concentration of mediator was detected in the anode chamber and the performance of the MFC gets worse. This work reports results that help to understand the main processes happening in the MFC. Crossover of ferrocyanide and ferricyanide to the anodic chamber reduces efficiency in the production of electricity The couple ferrocyanide/ferricyanide in the cathode chamber of an MFC can improve the performance in terms of COD removal and energy efficiency At low mediator concentration, a maximum in the power generation and COD removal can be attained At high mediator concentration, there was inhibition of biodegradation of winery wastewater.

After controlling for a series of sociodemographic and psychosocial factors, it was predicted that national levels of wealth, postmaterialism, education development, and environmental problems are positively related to environmental behavior. The national-level variance is to a substantial degree explained by individual-level variables, capturing compositional effects. The remaining variance is explained by the contextual-level variables. All of the country-level variables are predictors in the expected direction, with the exception of environmental degradation, which is negatively related to behavior, and education development, which has no impact on private environmental behavior. More importantly, cross-level interactions show that in more developed countries, there are stronger relationships between proecological attitudes and reported proenvironmental behavior. These findings contribute to the growing cross-cultural research on environmental behavior pointing out the necessity of simultaneously assessing the effects of both individual and contextual-level forces affecting behavior across nations.

Effects of TiO2 nanoparticles and sunscreens on coastal marine microalgae: Ultraviolet radiation is key variable for toxicity assessment	ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Marine phytoplankton; Population drift; Sunscreens; TiO2 nanoparticles; Peroxides	UV-FILTERS; AMINOBENZOIC ACID; MYTILUS-GALLOPROVINCIALIS; DEGRADATION-PRODUCTS; AQUEOUS-SOLUTIONS; DAPHNIA-MAGNA; ENVIRONMENT; OXYGEN; NANOMATERIALS; FUTURE	Given the large numbers of sunbathers on beaches, sunscreen compounds are being released into the coastal aquatic environment in significant amounts. Until now the effect of these potential pollutants on microbiota has been not well-known. Phytoplankton is a key component of the microbiota community. It forms the basis of the aquatic trophic networks, and any change in the natural population of phytoplankton can affect the structure of aquatic biota. This paper describes an experiment performed outdoors (in natural sunlight conditions including ultraviolet radiation (UVR) and with UVR blocked) on mixed microalgae populations (four species from different key marine taxonomic groups, Nannochloropsis gaditana, Chaetoceros gracilis, Pleurochrysis roscoffensis and Amphidinium carterae), for three days, exposed to a range of concentrations of three commercial sunscreens (with variable TiO2 concentrations: highest concentration for sunscreen C, followed by sunscreen A; and sunscreen B did not contain TiO2 in its composition). With regard to UVR effect, in the absence of sunscreens, the most sensitive species is the centric diatom, Chaetoceros gracilis, and the least is Nannochloropsis gaditana; this last species presented the same behavior in the absence of UVR and with high sunscreen concentrations. The toxicity gradient obtained for sunscreens and nanoparticles under UVR is: TiO2 NPs > Sunscreen C N Sunscreen A N Sunscreen B. The differential sensitivity of microalgae to sunscreens and TiO2 NPs can produce a change in the dynamics of phytoplankton populations and provoke undesirable ecological effects (such as giving dinoflagellates more prominence). The effects of UVR, commonly neglected in bioassays, could alter the results in important ways and should be considered when performing environmentally-relevant bioassays. The toxicity mediated by hydrogen peroxide production associated with the concentration of TiO2 NPs cannot be considered the only factor responsible for the toxicity: the organic compounds in the sunscreens must also be taken into account.

Exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals such as POPs has been linked to type 2 diabetes and metabolic disturbances in epidemiological and animal studies, but little is known about POPs exposure during pregnancy and the development of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). The purpose of this study was to determine the extent to which exposure to current low levels of different POPs in the first trimester of pregnancy is associated with GDM risk in 939 women from the "Rhea" pregnancy cohort in Crete, Greece. Methods: Concentrations of several PCBs, dichlorodiphenyldichloroethene (DDE), and hexachlorobenzene (HCB) were determined in first trimester maternal serum by triple quadrupole mass spectrometry. We defined total PCBs as the sum of all congeners, nondioxin-like PCBs as the sum of PCB 153, 138, 170 and 180, and dioxin-like PCBs as the sum of PCB 118 and 156. Pregnant women were screened for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) between 24 and 28 weeks of gestation, and GDM was defined by the criteria proposed by Carpenter and Coustan. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using multivariable logistic regression models. Results: Of the 939 women, 68 (7%) developed GDM. Serum concentrations of POPs were higher in women with GDM. Women in the medium and high tertiles of PCBs had 3.90 (95% CI: 1.37, 11.06) and 3.60 (95% CI: 1.14, 11.39) fold respectively higher odds of developing GDM compared to women in the lowest tertile of PCB exposure after adjusting for pre-pregnancy BMI and several other confounders. Odds of GDM for women in the medium and high tertiles of dioxin-like PCBs was 5.63 (95% CI: 1.81, 17.51) and 4.71 (95% CI: 1.38, 16.01) and for nondioxin-like PCBs 2.36 (95% CI: 0.89, 6.23) and 2.26 (95% CI: 0.77, 6.68) respectively. Prenatal DDE and HCB exposure were not significantly associated GDM risk. Conclusions: These findings suggest that women with high PCBs levels in early pregnancy had higher risk for GDM. Further studies are needed to replicate these results and to evaluate potential biological mechanisms underlying the observed associations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Paediatric patients (< 16 years, n = 17) were scanned twice, 24 h apart, using DWI (6 b-values, 0-1000 mm(-2) s) at 1.5 T in a prospective study. Tumour ROIs were drawn (3 slices) and all data fitted using IVIM, stretched exponential, and kurtosis models; percentage coefficients of variation (CV) calculated for each parameter at all ROI histogram centiles, including the medians. The values for ADC, D, DDC alpha, alpha, and DDCK gave CV < 10 % down to the 5th centile, with sharp CV increases below 5th and above 95th centile. K, f, and D* showed increased CV (> 30 %) over the histogram. ADC, D, DDC alpha, and DDCK were strongly correlated (rho > 0.9), DDC alpha and alpha were not correlated (rho = 0.083). Perfusion- and kurtosis-related parameters displayed larger, more variable CV across the histogram, indicating observed clinical changes outside of D/DDC in these models should be interpreted with caution. Centiles below 5th for all parameters show high CV and are unreliable as diffusion metrics. The stretched exponential model behaved well for both DDC alpha and alpha, making it a strong candidate for modelling multiple-b-value diffusion imaging data. aEuro cent ADC has good repeatability as low 5th centile of the histogram distribution. aEuro cent High CV was observed for all parameters at extremes of histogram. aEuro cent Parameters from the stretched exponential model showed low coefficients of variation. aEuro cent The median ADC, D, DDC (alpha) , and DDC (K) are highly correlated and repeatable. aEuro cent Perfusion/kurtosis parameters showed high CV variations across their histogram distributions.

Alternative routes for peptide delivery are preferred because of their ease of administration and increased patient compliance. Areas covered: This review provides a critical overview of current strategies for non-invasive mucosal delivery routes of therapeutic proteins and peptides, with emphasis on their advantages and limitations. Selected new trends and interesting novel formulations in advanced preclinical and clinical development stages for the pulmonary, nasal and the oral route are discussed for the most relevant peptide and protein drugs in terms of their specific requirements and intended therapeutic applications. Expert opinion: Despite the low frequency of clinical breakthroughs with non-invasive routes, these remain an active research area not only due to their improved therapeutic potential, but also due to the attractive commercial outcomes they offer. Currently, a number of technologies are adopted, including combinations of penetration enhancers with protease inhibitors and/or nanotechnology-based products and a few candidates are anticipated to be approved in the near future.

Clinical advances of nanocarrier-based cancer therapy and diagnostics	EXPERT OPINION ON DRUG DELIVERY			English	Review						Cancer; nanotherapeutics; polymeric drug delivery systems; nanotheranostic	SUPERPARAMAGNETIC IRON-OXIDE; NANOPARTICLE-DRUG CONJUGATE; TOPOISOMERASE-I-INHIBITOR; OF-THE-ART; PHASE-I; POLYMERIC MICELLES; SOLID TUMORS; PERSONALIZED MEDICINE; CONTRAST AGENTS; PHOTODYNAMIC THERAPY	Introduction: Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide and efficient new strategies are urgently needed to combat its high mortality and morbidity statistics. Fortunately, over the years, nanotechnology has evolved as a frontrunner in the areas of imaging, diagnostics and therapy, giving the possibility of monitoring, evaluating and individualizing cancer treatments in real-time. Areas covered: Polymer-based nanocarriers have been extensively studied to maximize cancer treatment efficacy and minimize the adverse effects of standard therapeutics. Regarding diagnosis, nano-materials like quantum dots, iron oxide nanoparticles or gold nanoparticles have been developed to provide rapid, sensitive detection of cancer and, therefore, facilitate early treatment and monitoring of the disease. Therefore, multifunctional nanosystems with both imaging and therapy functionalities bring us a step closer to delivering precision/personalized medicine in the cancer setting. Expert opinion: There are multiple barriers for these new nanosystems to enter the clinic, but it is expected that in the near future, nanocarriers, together with new 'targeted drugs', could replace our current treatments and cancer could become a nonfatal disease with good recovery rates. Joint efforts between scientists, clinicians, the pharmaceutical industry and legislative bodies are needed to bring to fruition the application of nanosystems in the clinical management of cancer.

Targeting pancreatic expressed PAX genes for the treatment of diabetes mellitus and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors	EXPERT OPINION ON THERAPEUTIC TARGETS			English	Review						Diabetes mellitus; pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors; PAX genes; PAX2; PAX4; PAX6; PAX8	BETA-CELL DEDIFFERENTIATION; PAIRED BOX GENE; ENDOCRINE TUMORS; EARLY-ONSET; CONGENITAL HYPOTHYROIDISM; TRANSCRIPTIONAL REPRESSOR; LINEAGE SPECIFICATION; ISLET DEVELOPMENT; INSULINOMA CELLS; PROGENITOR CELLS	Introduction: Four members of the PAX family, PAX2, PAX4, PAX6 and PAX8 are known to be expressed in the pancreas. Accumulated evidences indicate that several pancreatic expressed PAX genes play a significant role in pancreatic development/functionality and alterations in these genes are involved in the pathogenesis of pancreatic diseases. Areas covered: In this review, we summarize the ongoing research related to pancreatic PAX genes in diabetes mellitus and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. We dissect the current knowledge at different levels; from mechanistic studies in cell lines performed to understand the molecular processes controlled by pancreatic PAX genes, to in vivo studies using rodent models that over-express or lack specific PAX genes. Finally, we describe human studies associating variants on pancreatic-expressed PAX genes with pancreatic diseases. Expert opinion: Based on the current literature, we propose that future interventions to treat pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors and diabetes mellitus could be developed via the modulation of PAX4 and/or PAX6 regulated pathways.

J	Alonso-Villar, O; del Rio, C				Alonso-Villar, Olga; del Rio, Coral			THE OCCUPATIONAL SEGREGATION OF AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMEN: ITS EVOLUTION FROM 1940 TO 2010	FEMINIST ECONOMICS			English	Article						Occupational segregation; race and gender; well-being; wages; indicators	CIVIL-RIGHTS ACT; BLACK-WOMEN; GENDER; RACE; DISCRIMINATION; SEX; PROGRESS; CENSUS; SYSTEM; TRENDS	Based on detailed occupation titles and making use of measures that do not require pair-wise comparisons, this paper shows that the occupational segregation of African American women declined dramatically in 1940-80, decreased slightly in 1980-2000, and remained stagnant in 2000-10. This paper quantifies the well-being losses that African American women derive from their occupational sorting. The reduction of segregation was indeed accompanied by well-being improvements, especially in the 1960s and 1970s. Regarding the role that education has played, this study highlights that it was only from 1990 onward that African American women with either some college or university degrees had lower segregation (as compared with their peers) than those with lower education. Nevertheless, the well-being loss that African American women with university degrees derived in 2010 for being segregated from their peers in education was not too different from that of African American women with lower education.

Coherent Structures in a Non-equilibrium Large-Velocity-Defect Turbulent Boundary Layer	FLOW TURBULENCE AND COMBUSTION			English	Article						Turbulence simulation; Turbulent boundary layers; Wall-bounded turbulence; Adverse pressure gradient; Coherent structures; Two-point correlations; Quadrant analysis	ADVERSE-PRESSURE-GRADIENT; OUTER REGION; SEPARATION; CHANNELS; EDDIES	The characteristics of the coherent structures in a strongly decelerated large-velocity-defect boundary layer are analysed by direct numerical simulation. The simulated boundary layer starts as a zero-pressure-gradient boundary layer, decelerates under a strong adverse pressure gradient, and separates near the end of the domain, in the form of a very thin separation bubble. The Reynolds number at separation is R e (oee integral) =3912 and the shape factor H=3.43. The three-dimensional spatial correlations of (u, u) and (u, v) are investigated and compared to those of a zero-pressure-gradient boundary layer and another strongly decelerated boundary layer. These velocity pairs lose coherence in the streamwise and spanwise directions as the velocity defect increases. In the outer region, the shape of the correlations suggest that large-scale u structures are less streamwise elongated and more inclined with respect to the wall in large-defect boundary layers. The three-dimensional properties of sweeps and ejections are characterized for the first time in both the zero-pressure-gradient and adverse-pressure-gradient boundary layers, following the method of Lozano-Duran et al. (J. Fluid Mech. 694, 100-130, [2012]). Although longer sweeps and ejections are found in the zero-pressure-gradient boundary layer, with ejections reaching streamwise lengths of 5 boundary layer thicknesses, the sweeps and ejections tend to be bigger in the adverse-pressure-gradient boundary layer. Moreover, small near-wall sweeps and ejections are much less numerous in the large-defect boundary layer. Large sweeps and ejections that reach the wall region (wall-attached) are also less numerous, less streamwise elongated and they occupy less space than in the zero-pressure-gradient boundary layer.

J	Tillmar, AO; Phillips, C				Tillmar, Andreas O.; Phillips, Chris			Evaluation of the impact of genetic linkage in forensic identity and relationship testing for expanded DNA marker sets	FORENSIC SCIENCE INTERNATIONAL-GENETICS			English	Article						Biostatistics; Random match calculations; Relationship testing; Linkage; Linkage disequilibrium; Simulation; CODIS loci	IDENTIFICATION; DISTANCES; LOCI; HAPMAP; VALUES	Advances in massively parallel sequencing technology have enabled the combination of a much-expanded number of DNA markers (notably STRs and SNPs in one or combined multiplexes), with the aim of increasing the weight of evidence in forensic casework. However, when data from multiple loci on the same chromosome are used, genetic linkage can affect the final likelihood calculation. In order to study the effect of linkage for different sets of markers we developed the biostatistical tool ILIR, (Impact of Linkage on forensic markers for Identity and Relationship tests). The ILIR tool can be used to study the overall impact of genetic linkage for an arbitrary set of markers used in forensic testing. Application of ILIR can be useful during marker selection and design of new marker panels, as well as being highly relevant for existing marker sets as a way to properly evaluate the effects of linkage on a case-by-case basis. ILIR, implemented via the open source platform R, includes variation and genomic position reference data for over 40 STRs and 140 SNPs, combined with the ability to include additional forensic markers of interest. The use of the software is demonstrated with examples from several different established marker sets (such as the expanded CODIS core loci) including a review of the interpretation of linked genetic data.

A collaborative EDNAP exercise on SNaPshot (TM)-based mtDNA control region typing	FORENSIC SCIENCE INTERNATIONAL-GENETICS			English	Article						Forensic science; mtDNA; SNaPshot; Haplogroup; Massively parallel sequencing	SINGLE-NUCLEOTIDE POLYMORPHISMS; MITOCHONDRIAL-DNA VARIATION; IDENTIFICATION; HETEROPLASMY; HAPLOGROUPS; SEQUENCES; SAMPLES	A collaborative European DNA Profiling (EDNAP) Group exercise was undertaken to assess the performance of an earlier described SNaPshot (TM)-based screening assay (denoted mini-mtSNaPshot) (Weiler et al., 2016) [1] that targets 18 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) positions in the mitochondrial (mt) DNA control region and allows for discrimination of major European mtDNA haplogroups. Besides the organising laboratory, 14 forensic genetics laboratories were involved in the analysis of 13 samples, which were centrally prepared and thoroughly tested prior to shipment. The samples had a variable complexity and comprised straightforward single-source samples, samples with dropout or altered peak sizing, a point heteroplasmy and two-component mixtures resulting in one to five bi-allelic calls. The overall success rate in obtaining useful results was high (97.6%) given that some of the participating laboratories had no previous experience with the typing technology and/or mtDNA analysis. The majority of the participants proceeded to haplotype inference to assess the feasibility of assigning a haplogroup and checking phylogenetic consistency when only 18 SNPs are typed. To mimic casework procedures, the participants compared the SNP typing data of all 13 samples to a set of eight mtDNA reference profiles that were described according to standard nomenclature (Parson et al., 2014) [2], and indicated whether these references matched each sample or not. Incorrect scorings were obtained for 2% of the comparisons and derived from a subset of the participants, indicating a need for training and guidelines regarding mini-mtSNaPshot data interpretation.

Photoperiod modulates the reproductive axis of European sea bass through regulation of kiss1 and gnrh2 neuronal expression	GENERAL AND COMPARATIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Article						Kisspeptin; Gonadotropin-releasing hormone; Gonadotropins; Androgens; Photoperiod; Puberty; Teleost	LIGHT INHIBITS PRECOCITY; LONG-TERM EXPOSURE; COD GADUS-MORHUA; DICENTRARCHUS-LABRAX; SEXUAL-MATURATION; GENE-EXPRESSION; ATLANTIC COD; RECEPTOR EXPRESSION; GONADOTROPIN GENES; PITUITARY LEVELS	The onset of puberty is characterized by activation of the brain-pituitary-gonad axis. However, the molecular and endocrine mechanism involved in the process of puberty and the influence of environmental conditions, such as photoperiod signalling, are not well understood in fish. In this study, 1-year-old male European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) were exposed to photoperiod manipulation in combination with size-sorting. Two treatment groups, a puberty accelerating photoperiod (AP) group and a continuous light (LL) group, were studied from August to February. Our results indicate that AP and LL are able to entrain the rhythms of both kissi and gnrh2 mRNA levels in the brain, while kiss2 and gnrh1 mRNA expression does not seem to be directly affected by the photoperiod, at least during testicular growth. It is likely that AP and LL photoperiod regimes affected both plasma Fsh and 11-KI profiles, which might explain, respectively, the phase shift and reduction of testes maturation seen under these conditions. We therefore hypothesize that the unbalanced production of this androgen regulated by circulating Fsh might be limiting the stimulation of germ cell proliferation in European sea bass males. In summary, our study establishes that photoperiod modulates the expression of kissi and gnrh2 in the forebrain-midbrain, which may be involved in the translation of the light stimulus to activate the reproductive axis.

Although many studies have evaluated the effect of fed-to-starved transition on the expression of appetite-related genes, little is known about how the expression of appetite-regulating peptides is regulated by the macronutrient composition of the diet. The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of diet composition and nutritional status on the expression of four peptides involved in food intake control in gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata): neuropeptide Y (NPY), ghrelin, cholecystokinin (CCK) and leptin. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR showed that high protein/low carbohydrate diets stimulated the expression of CCK and ghrelin in the intestine and leptin in the adipose tissue, while downregulation of ghrelin and NPY mRNA levels was observed in the brain. Opposite effects were found for the expression of the four genes in fish fed low protein/high carbohydrate diets or after long-term starvation. Our findings indicate that the expression pattern of appetite-regulating peptides, particularly CCK and ghrelin, is modulated by the nutritional status and diet composition in S. aurata.

Acute ACTH-induced elevations of circulating cortisol do not affect hair cortisol concentrations in calves	GENERAL AND COMPARATIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Article						ACTH; Animal welfare; Bovine; Blood cortisol; Hair cortisol; Stress	ADRENOCORTICOTROPIC HORMONE CHALLENGE; FUTURE-DIRECTIONS; EXTERNAL FACTORS; DAIRY-CATTLE; BODY REGION; CORTICOSTERONE; VALIDATION; COWS; AGE	In recent times, the detection of cortisol in hair is intended to be used as an animal-based indicator for the assessment of chronic stress. However, the relationship between the ability to report average values of long-term circulating cortisol concentrations and the sensitivity to acute peaks of cortisol is still unclear. To gain insight into this relationship, 24 Holstein-Friesian bull calves under the same management conditions were used in this study. Two injections of ACTH (at D-0 and D-7) were administrated to twelve animals with the aim to create two acute increases of serum cortisol concentrations. Blood samples were taken in order to determine the duration of serum cortisol peaks and to confirm a mediated response by the administration of ACTH. Cortisol concentrations from 14-day-old white hair samples collected from forehead and hip were analysed separately by EIA and compared with those from the control group. Serum cortisol analyses revealed an acute increase of cortisol concentrations for approximately three hours after each ACTH administration. Concentrations of hair cortisol from forehead and hip locations showed no differences between ACTH-administrated and control animals. Hair cortisol concentrations from 14-day old samples were not altered by two acute elevations of serum cortisol suggesting that hair cortisol is not masked by short and non-recurrent moments of stress. These results are a step forward in the validation of hair cortisol detection as a robust integrative measure of serum cortisol concentrations from an extended period of time. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

In the resulting coupled system of equations, the balance of momentum equation remains unaltered, while the mass balance equation for the pore fluid is stabilized with the inclusion of higher-order terms multiplied by arbitrary dimensions in space, following the finite calculus (FIC) procedure. The stabilized FIC-FEM formulation can be applied to any kind of interpolation for the displacements and the pressure, but in this work, we have used linear elements of equal order interpolation for both set of unknowns. Examples in 2D and 3D are presented to illustrate the accuracy of the stabilized formulation for solid-pore fluid interaction problems. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

They concern the model matching and the measured disturbance rejection problems. The model matching problem is a tracking control problem with specifications given as acceptable deviations from an ideal response. The measured disturbance rejection problem balances feedback and feedforward actions to reject disturbances. Both perspectives present advantages over classical quantitative feedback theory techniques in certain situations. This paper develops the necessary tools to solve both control problems in the case of multi-input multi-output plants. In particular, it shows how to derive nonconservative controller bounds for each of the single-input single-output control problems in which the overall multivariable problem is divided. The result is a systematic controller design methodology for multi-input multi-output plants with structured uncertainty. The application of the technique to the well-known quadruple-tank process illustrates the benefits of the method. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Co-channel interference cancelation at the user terminal in multibeam satellite systems	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SATELLITE COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING			English	Article						multibeam satellite systems; co-channel interference; interference cancelation; BGAN	SPECTRAL EFFICIENCY; MATHEMATICAL-THEORY; COMMUNICATION; SIGNALS	We study the applicability of soft interference cancelation in the forward link of multibeam satellite systems with focus on mobile terminals. We adopt a standard currently used in commercial satellite systems as a reference. The multibeam satellite antenna radiation diagram has been generated using a physical optics reflector model while a widely adopted channel model has been used for the land mobile satellite channel. The interference pattern has been derived using a system simulator developed by the European Space Agency. Starting from the analysis of the interference pattern, we study the application of a low-complexity soft interference cancelation scheme for commercial applications. Our results show that, under realistic conditions, a two-colors frequency reuse scheme can be employed while guaranteeing service availability across the coverage and keeping the complexity at the user terminals relatively low.

The present authors examine family quality of life (FQoL), identify the individual services required and assess families' perceptions of the extent to which their family member with intellectual disability and they themselves receive the services they need. Materials and Methods The N&S questionnaire (Needs and Supports for people with intellectual disability and their families) was administered to 2160 families with a family member with intellectual disability aged under 70 in Catalonia (Spain). Results Overall mean FQoL was quite high. FQoL was associated with family income, education, employment and percentage level of disability. Neither people with intellectual disability nor their families receive the specific support they need. Conclusions Besides providing specific support for individuals with intellectual disability, local policymakers and practitioners should apply a family-centred approach to the provision of support for families in order to improve FQoL.

The occurrence of parenchymal hemorrhage is clinically relevant and increases with reperfusion therapies. Herein we aimed to examine the optimal perfusion CT-derived parameters and the impact of the duration of brain ischemia for the prediction of parenchymal hemorrhage after endovascular therapy. A cohort of 146 consecutive patients with anterior circulation occlusions and treated with endovascular reperfusion therapy was analyzed. Recanalization was assessed at the end of reperfusion treatment, and the rate of parenchymal hemorrhage at follow-up neuroimaging. In regression analyses, cerebral blood volume and cerebral blood flow performed better than Delay Time maps for the prediction of parenchymal hemorrhage. The most informative thresholds (receiver operating curves) for relative cerebral blood volume and relative cerebral blood flow were values lower than 2.5% of normal brain. In binary regression analyses, the volume of regions with reduced relative cerebral blood volume and/or relative cerebral blood flow was significantly associated with an increased risk of parenchymal hemorrhage, as well as delayed vessel recanalization. These results highlight the relevance of the severity and duration of ischemia as drivers of blood-brain barrier disruption in acute ischemic stroke and support the role of perfusion CT for the prediction of parenchymal hemorrhage.

However, the precise time course of these changes in relation to tissue and behavioral outcome remains unsettled. To address these issues, a three-dimensional wide field-of-view and real-time quantitative functional imaging technique able to map perfusion in the rodent brain would be desirable. Here, we applied functional ultrasound imaging, a novel approach to map relative cerebral blood volume without contrast agent, in a rat model of brief proximal transient middle cerebral artery occlusion to assess perfusion in penetrating arterioles and venules acutely and over six days thanks to a thinned-skull preparation. Functional ultrasound imaging efficiently mapped the acute changes in relative cerebral blood volume during occlusion and following reperfusion with high spatial resolution (100 mu m), notably documenting marked focal decreases during occlusion, and was able to chart the fine dynamics of tissue reperfusion (rate: one frame/5 s) in the individual rat. No behavioral and only mild post-mortem immunofluorescence changes were observed.

Combining bioadsorption and photoelectrochemical oxidation for the treatment of soil-washing effluents polluted with herbicide 2,4-D	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL TECHNOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY			English	Article						2,4-D; bioadsorption; electrolysis; photoelectrolysis; soil washing	DIAMOND ELECTROCHEMICAL OXIDATION; SYNTHETIC ORGANIC-DYES; 2,4-DICHLOROPHENOXYACETIC ACID; BATCH BIOSORPTION; PILOT-PLANT; WASTE-WATER; DEGRADATION; REMOVAL; REMEDIATION; WASTEWATERS	BACKGROUND: The aim of this work is to evaluate the effectiveness of complete treatment of soil spiked with 2,4-D, consisting of soil washing, followed by bioadsorption with activated sludge and electrochemical and photoelectrochemical oxidation of resulting wastewater using BDD anodes combined with UV light irradiation. RESULTS: Results show that 2,4-D is very efficiently removed from synthetic soil by soil-washing without the use of surfactants. The effluent can be treated by bioadsorption with fresh activated sludge coming from a municipal wastewater treatment plant and the maximum adsorption capacity is 0.012 mg 2,4-D mg(-1) biomass. Despite the low contact time between the biomass and the soil-washing effluent, results fit well to a Langmuir isotherm. CONCLUSIONS: Photoelectrolysis with diamond anodes is more efficient than single electrolysis and the influence of potential radicalary oxidants produced on the anode surface from sulfate and chloride and activated by UV light can explain the better results. Both electrolysis and photoelectrolysis can lead to the complete mineralization of 2,4-D, regardless of the biomass/herbicide ratio applied in the previous bioadsorption process.

The microalga Chlorella vulgaris was used to maximize the production of lipids and carbohydrates. The culture medium was prepared with vegetable waste and diluted in the following proportions of medium:water: 1:0, 1:1, 1:2 and 1:3; the resulting solutions were adjusted for three different pH values (5.5, 7.2, 8.5). For a comparative analysis, modified CHU-10 medium was used. RESULTS: The initial concentration of carbon in the medium was 279.6 +/- 3.5 mg L-1, while nitrogen was 11.22 +/- 1.32 mg L-1. The growth in heterotrophic conditions was performed for 21 days, during which it was observed that higher concentrations of biomass and higher productivity of lipids and carbohydrates were obtained in cultures performed in medium without dilution (1:0) and pH 5.5; however, higher yields of lipids and carbohydrates were obtained when the medium was diluted in the proportion 1:3 and with alkaline pH. CONCLUSION: The results of this study should encourage the use of vegetable waste as raw material for the production of microalgae rich in lipids and carbohydrates for the production of environmentally friendly fuels.

Successful results have been reported with readily biodegradable substrates, but the performance with real complex substrates needs to be evaluated to bridge the gap between lab- and full-scale. This work aims at studying bioelectrochemical hydrogen production using real cheese whey as sole substrate. RESULTS: A microbial consortium able to consume cheese whey to produce electricity or H-2 was developed. Cheese whey was fermented mainly by lactic acid bacteria (Enterococcus genus) and exoelectrogenic activity was performed by Geobacter sp. The coulombic efficiency was 49 +/- 8 /o in the MFC fed only with cheese whey, which is higher than most previous values reported for MFCs fed with dairy products. Good results for H-2 production in MEC (0.8 L-H2 L-REACTOR(-1) d(-1)) were also obtained. CONCLUSION: The high potentiality of cheese whey as carbon source for bioelectrochemical systems is demonstrated in this study. The populations involved were determined by advanced microbial tools.The efficient selection of a syntrophic consortium to produce H-2 directly from cheese whey in a single-chamber MEC was demonstrated (C) 2016 Society of Chemical Industry	[Rago, Laura; Baeza, Juan A.; Guisasola, Albert] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Engn Quim Biol & Ambiental, Escola Engn, GENOCOV, Bellaterra 08193, Barcelona, Spain	Baeza, JA (reprint author), Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Engn Quim Biol & Ambiental, Escola Engn, Bellaterra 08193, Barcelona, Spain.

RESULTS: Scanning electron microscopy revealed structural degradation of both exine and intine strata. Fourier-Transformed Infrared Spectroscopy was applied to characterize chemical modification of the pollen grains subjected to photocatalysis. Study of physical properties modification for the pollen extracts was carried out through spectrophotometry and wettability tests. It was found that photocatalysis resulted in significant decrease of C-H and C-O groups and a moderate decrease in C = O. Also, chromaticity values of the pollen extract after photocatalysis tended to approach those of the substrate. Contact angle of water dispersion of the pollen extract was not altered by photocatalysis, but adherence of the components of the pollen extract to Si substrate considerably decreased. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together these results provided solid evidence for the degradation of all pollen components including exine and intine enzymes on nanofunctionalized photocatalytic materials.

The performance of a Streptomyces lividans mutant strain, deficient in the major signal peptidase (SipY) is investigated for the production of proteins secreted via the secondary Tat pathway. RESULTS: The SipY deficient strain has shown advantages over the wild type strain, in terms of extracellular productivity, specific activity and rheological behaviour. Two operational modes, batch and fed-batch, have been studied using mannitol as carbon source. The results showed that two successive mannitol additions in fed-batch mode led to improved secretory protein production using Streptomyces agarase as a model protein. This production process was also explored for the Tat secretory protein S. lividans lactase. The predicted sequence for the pre-lactase coding sequence has been cloned into the mutant strain under the control of the agarase promoter. Batch and fed-batch lactase production, using either mannitol or glucose as carbon source, have been developed and quantified. CONCLUSIONS: The usefulness of a Streptomyces lividans SipY deficient strain as protein producer has been demonstrated. A proposed operating mode with substrate additions has been employed for the optimisation of Tat proteins production, although some adjustments might be necessary depending on the secretory protein.

An 8.5 wt% of Pinus radiata wood flour reinforcement was added to the phenolic foam. A commercial phenolic resol was used as the matrix for the foam. The wood flour-reinforced foam showed a structure similar to the phenolic foam according to the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy results. The wood flour increased the thermal stability of the phenolic foam in the first stage of thermal degradation (T-5%), decreased it in the second step (T-25%), and negligibly influenced the final stage. The activation energies of the degradation processes of the studied materials were obtained by the Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose and Flynn-Wall-Ozawa model-free kinetic methods and a 2-Gaussian distributed activation energy model. The values of the activation energies obtained by the model-free kinetic methods for the first degradation stage of the phenolic foams were in a range between 110 and 170 kJ mol(-1), whereas for the wood flour it was 162 kJ mol(-1) for almost all of the conversion range of its main degradation stage. The applied models showed good fits for all the materials, and the activation energies calculated were in agreement with the values found in the literature.	[Dominguez, J.

We determined that in addition to A(2B) receptors, human epidermal keratinocytes also express A(2A) receptors, although to a lower extent. Through the use of selective adenosine receptor agonists and antagonists, we showed that physiological concentrations of adenosine activate A(2B) receptors in normal human keratinocytes, inducing cell cycle arrest through the increase of intracellular calcium but not through cAMP signaling. In contrast, the selective activation of A(2A) receptors by CGS-21680 induces keratinocyte proliferation via p38-mitogen-activated protein kinase activation. Adenosine and selective A(2A) and A(2B) agonists presented anti-inflammatory profiles independent of adenosine receptors but mediated by membrane phosphatase activation. Finally, keratinocyte exposure to diverse inflammatory cytokines altered adenosine receptor expression by reducing A(2B) and increasing A(2A), a pattern also observed in psoriatic epidermis. Because increased epidermal turnover and inflammatory response are characteristics of psoriatic disease, further studies are needed to assess the role and consequences of the altered adenosine receptor expression in lesional and nonlesional psoriatic keratinocytes.

To study potential mechanisms driving this disease in clinically characterized cases, we searched for somatic mutations using whole-exome sequencing, and extrapolated our findings to study functional biomarkers reporting on the activity of the mutated pathways. Confirming previous results, Merkel cell polyomavirus-negative tumors had higher mutational loads with UV signatures and more frequent mutations in TP53 and RB compared with their Merkel cell polyomavirus-positive counterparts. Despite important genetic differences, the two Merkel cell carcinoma etiologies both exhibited nuclear accumulation of oncogenic transcription factors such as NFAT or nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), P-CREB, and P-STAT3, indicating commonly deregulated pathogenic mechanisms with the potential to serve as targets for therapy. A multi-variable analysis identified phosphorylated CRE-binding protein as an independent survival factor with respect to clinical variables and Merkel cell polyomavirus status in our cohort of Merkel cell carcinoma patients.

Methods: We report three cases of intestinal atresia at different intestinal levels verified during the neonatal surgery with specific ultrasonographic prenatal features. Intensity of sonolucency was analyzed using the image-processing program ImageJ for quantitative measurements based on the gray-scale intensity values. Results: A total of three cases are reported, a jejunal, an ileal and a colonic atresia. All cases showed intestinal dilatation. Both, jejunal and ileal atresia, showed two degrees of hypoechoic intestinal content, while colonic atresia showed hyperechogenic content dilated loop at prenatal ultrasound scan. Conclusions: We propose the use of prenatal ultrasounds echogenicity of intestinal dilated loop fluid content to help in determining the level of obstruction in bowel atresia. These are initial results, to be confirmed by a multicentric research with more cases.

However, to date there have been no comparative studies evaluating both techniques. We herein present the firt study comparing S and T techniques for pediatric sedation in MRI procedures. Materials and methods: 21 children, aged from 3 months to 6 years, scheduled for MRI were randomly assigned to either S or T group. Sedation performed under spontaneous respiration was induced with inspired 1-8% S in oxigen by face mask connected to a Mapleson C circuit or T (25 mg/ kg) administered in distal rectum by cannula. The observed parameters included: time for induction, MRI time, first movement activity postprocedure and recovery time; MRI pauses from patient movement; technique failure, quality of the study, emergence agitation, critical events; and parental and radiologist satisfaction. Results: S compared with T showed significantly shorter anesthesia induction time (1.93 +/- 0.7 versus 13.5 +/- 2.6 min), first movement time (3.38 +/- 1.2 versus 5.9 +/- 2.1 min), recovery time (6.8 +/- 1.6 versus 10.14 +/- 3.3 min), and discharge MRI time (27.83 +/- 5.1 versus 47.5 +/- 8.7 min). There were fewer pauses during MRI from patient movement in S versus T (0 versus 3). The radiologists reported good quality and satisfaction scores in both groups. There were less behavioral disturbances in T group compared with S group (1 versus 3). There were no critical events in either group. There were no differences in parental satisfaction in both groups. Conclusions: Sevoflurane shortens the induction and recovery time, enabling earlier discharge. Sevoflurane and rectal thiopental sodium protocols are safe and effective, providing adequate conditions for MRI in pediatric outpatients, although rectal thiopental is more unpredictable.

Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms involved are mostly unknown, which hinders our capacity to develop effective intervention policies. Here, we discuss the hypothesis that mechanisms underlying prenatal programming of adult risk are epigenetic and sensitive to environmental cues such as nutrition. While the information encoded in DNA is essentially stable, regulatory epigenetic mechanisms include reversible, covalent modifications of DNA and chromatin, such as methylation, acetylation etc. It is known that dietary availability of methyl donors has an impact on the patterns of gene expression by affecting DNA methylation at regulatory regions, a likely basis for reprogramming developmental plasticity. The Agouti and Axin-Psed genes, as well as the embryonic growth factor IGF2/H19 locus are examples of diet-induced modulation of phenotypic traits by affecting methylation of gene-regulatory regions. Recent work has evidenced an unsuspected role for chromatin as metabolic sensor. Chromatin is susceptible to a number of post-translational modifications that modulate gene expression, among them the GIcNAcylation of histone proteins and other epigenetic regulators. Intracellular levels of the precursor molecule UDP-GIcNAc, and hence the degree of global chromatin GIcNAcylation, depend on the energetic state of the cell, making GIcNAcylation a functional link between nutrition and regulation of gene expression. Dietary interference with these regulatory mechanisms could effectively counteract the early-life programming of adult risk. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Exogenous fatty acids and niacin on acute prostaglandin D-2 production in human myeloid cells	JOURNAL OF NUTRITIONAL BIOCHEMISTRY			English	Article						Niacin; Exogenous fatty acids; Postprandial state; Prostaglandin D-2; Myeloid cells	NICOTINIC-ACID; IN-VITRO; PROSTANOID RECEPTORS; INTERNATIONAL UNION; MACROPHAGES; GPR109A; EXPRESSION; CLASSIFICATION; DYSLIPIDEMIA; METABOLITES	Niacin activates HCA(2) receptor that results in the release of PGD(2). However, little is known on PGD(2)-producing cells and the role of fatty acids. Notably M-CSF macrophages exhibited a timely dependent PGD(2) production upon niacin challenge. Short pretreatment of M-CSF macrophages with autologous postprandial TRLs induced the down-regulation of HCA(2) gene and up-regulation of genes encoding COXI and COX2 enzymes in a fatty acid-dependent manner. These effects were paralleled by a higher PGD(2) production with postprandial TRL-SFAs. The niacin-mediated transcriptional activity of all genes involved in PGD2 biosynthesis was desensitized in a time-dependent manner by postprandial TRLs, leading to a decreased PGD(2) release. In vivo, the net excursions of PGD(2) in plasma followed similar fatty acid-dependent patterns as those found for PGD(2) release in vitro. The predominant fatty acid class in the diet acutely modulates PGD2 biosynthetic pathway both in vitro and in vivo. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

However, the mechanisms by which either niacin or the byproducts of its catabolism ameliorate these inflammatory diseases are not clear yet. Human circulating monocytes and mature macrophages were used to analyze the effects of niacin and its metabolites (NAM, NUA and 2-Pyr) on oxidative stress, plasticity and inflammatory response by using biochemical, flow cytometry, quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot technologies. Niacin, NAM and 2-Pyr significantly decreased ROS, NO and NOS2 expression in LPS-treated human mature macrophages. Niacin and NAM skewed macrophage polarization toward antiinflammatory M2 macrophage whereas a trend toward proinflammatory M1 macrophage was noted following treatment with NUA. Niacin and NAM also reduced the inflammatory competence of LPS-treated human mature macrophages and promoted bias toward antiinflammatory CD14(+) CD16(++) nonclassical human primary monocytes. This study reveals for the first time that niacin and its metabolites possess antioxidant, reprogramming and antiinflammatory properties on human primary monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages. Our findings imply a new understanding of the mechanisms by which niacin and its metabolites favor a continuous and gradual plasticity process in the human monocyte/macrophage system.

Amine Containing Cationic Methacrylate Copolymers as Efficient Gene Delivery Vehicles to Retinal Epithelial Cells	JOURNAL OF POLYMER SCIENCE PART A-POLYMER CHEMISTRY			English	Article						block copolymers; copolymers; drug delivery systems; gene therapy; epithelial cells; polyelectrolytes	TRANSFECTION EFFICIENCY; IN-VIVO; NONVIRAL VECTORS; THERAPY; POLYELECTROLYTES; NANOPARTICLES; CHITOSAN; DNA; POLYPLEXES; COMPLEXES	Non-viral gene delivery vectors have emerged as potential alternatives in the field of gene therapy by replacing the biological viral vectors. DNA-cationic polymer complexes are one of the most promising systems to target many inborn or acquired diseases without the utilization of conventional drugs. Despite the excellent binding efficiency of cationic polymers, the gene transfection seems limited to date. In this work, a series of ammonium-based block-copolymers with different alkyl side chains (ethyl, butyl, and hexyl) and functionality (alcohol, amine, and alkyl) have been prepared to evaluate their capacity to deliver genetic material. First, different ionic liquid monomers with different pendent functional groups were prepared and characterized. Then, polyplexes elaborated with different polymers at several polymer DNA ratios w/w) were characterized in terms of size, zeta potential, and DNA binding, release, and protection capacity. Finally, the transfection efficiency and cell viability was evaluated in ARPE19 cells. We found that only the systems containing the amine pendent group were able to transfect ARPE19 cell and, that this amine containing polymer was less cytotoxic even at high polymer/DNA ratios 30: 1). In conclusion, our studies suggested that the proper selection of the pendent group substantially impacts overall transfection efficiency of cationic polymers. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Objectives: To identify and compare perceived barriers related to behavioral health care among first-and second-generation Latinos in Boston, Madrid, and Barcelona, and evaluate whether the frequency of behavioral health care use in the last year was related to these barriers. Design, Setting, and Participants: Data were obtained from the International Latino Research Partnership project. First- or second-generation self-identified Latino immigrants aged 18 years and more who resided more than 1 year in the host country were recruited from community agencies and primary care, mental health, substance abuse, and HIV clinics. Main Outcome Measures: Eleven barriers were assessed and compared across sites. The relationship between barriers and behavioral services visits within the last yearwas evaluated, adjusting for sociodemographics, clinical measures, degree of health literacy, cultural, and social factors. Results: Wanting to handle the problem on one's own, thinking that treatment would not work, and being unsure of where to go or who to see were the most frequently reported barriers for Latino immigrants. Previous treatment failure, difficulties in transportation or scheduling, and linguistic barriers were more likely to be reported in Boston; trying to deal with mental health problems on one's own was more commonly reported in Barcelona and Madrid. Two barriers associated with the number of visits were concerns about the cost of services and uncertainty about where to go or who to see. Conclusions: After adjusting for sociodemographics, clinical measures, degree of health literacy, cultural, and social factors, barriers still differed significantly across sites. Efforts to improve behavioral health services must be tailored to immigrants' context, with attention to changing attitudes of self-reliance and outreach to improve access to and retention in care.

Lattice parameters and Ln-O bond lengths show a decrease with increasing Pr content. A small excess volume is observed for the solid solution. IR spectra of the solid solution members present no detectable differences, while a blue shift of the PO4-related modes is seen in the Raman data. This shift can be attributed to the lanthanide contraction. Within errors, calorimetry data show no systematic deviation from an ideal behavior, though one might interpret the data as an indication of a slightly asymmetric mixture. All data indicate that deviations from ideality of the solid solution if - present - are very small.

Given the delay in the consolidation of Spanish urban history, the contribution of related disciplines, such as art history and urban planning, geography, and economics is also assessed. Careful attention is paid to the identification of continuities and breaks, as well as to the contextualization of the changes in the cities in relation to their role in the national and international context. The article is divided into four parts. First, an introduction to the evolution of urban history in Spain is provided. Subsequent sections analyze the urban process in three stages: the enlightenment reforms and the end of colonial empire (1746-1833), the end of the Ancient Regime and the new capitalist development (1833-1936), and the transition from dictatorship to the integration into the European Union.

We assessed the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of lacosamide as a first-line monotherapy option for these patients. Methods In this phase 3, randomised, double-blind, non-inferiority trial, patients from 185 epilepsy or general neurology centres in Europe, North America, and the Asia Pacific region, aged 16 years or older and with newly diagnosed epilepsy were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio, via a computer-generated code, to receive lacosamide monotherapy or controlled-release carbamazepine (carbamazepine-CR) twice daily. Patients, investigators, and trial personnel were masked to treatment allocation. From starting doses of 100 mg/day lacosamide or 200 mg/day carbamazepine-CR, uptitration to the first target level of 200 mg/day and 400 mg/day, respectively, took place over 2 weeks. After a 1-week stabilisation period, patients entered a 6-month assessment period. If a seizure occurred, the dose was titrated to the next target level (400 or 600 mg/day for lacosamide and 800 or 1200 mg/day for carbamazepine-CR) over 2 weeks with a 1-week stabilisation period, and the 6-month assessment period began again. Patients who completed 6 months of treatment and remained seizure-free entered a 6-month maintenance period on the same dose. The primary efficacy outcome was the proportion of patients remaining free from seizures for 6 consecutive months after stabilisation at the last assessed dose. The predefined non-inferiority criteria were -12% absolute and -20% relative difference between treatment groups. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01243177. Findings The trial was done between April 27, 2011, and Aug 7, 2015. 888 patients were randomly assigned treatment. 444 patients taking lacosamide and 442 taking carbamazepine-CR were included in the full analysis set (took at least one dose of study treatment), and 408 and 397, respectively, were included in the per-protocol set. In the full analysis set, 327 (74%) patients in the lacosamide group and 308 (70%) in the carbamazepine-CR group completed 6 months of treatment without seizures. The proportion of patients in the full analysis set predicted by the Kaplan-Meier method to be seizure-free at 6 months was 90% taking lacosamide and 91% taking carbamazepineCR (absolute treatment-difference: -1.3%, 95% CI -5.5 to 2.8 relative treatment difference: -6.0%). Kaplan-Meier estimates results were similar in the per-protocol set (92% and 93%; -1.3%, -5.3 to 2.7; -5.7%). Treatment emergent adverse events were reported in 328 (74%) patients receiving lacosamide and 332 (75%) receiving carbamazepine-CR. 32 (7%) patients taking lacosamide and 43 (10%) taking carbamazepine-CR had serious treatment-emergent adverse events, and 47 (11%) and 69 (16%), respectively, had treatment-emergent adverse events that led to withdrawal. Interpretation Treatment with lacosamide met the predefined non-inferiority criteria when compared with carbamazepine-CR. Therefore, it might be useful as first-line monotherapy for adults with newly diagnosed epilepsy.

Modules over linear spaces admitting amultiplicative basis	LINEAR & MULTILINEAR ALGEBRA			English	Article						Multiplicative basis; representation theory; module over an algebra; algebra; structure theory	MULTIPLICATIVE BASES; ALGEBRAS	Let V and W be two vector spaces over a base field F. It is said that V is a module over W if it is endowed with a bilinear map V x W. V, (v, w) -> vw. A basis B = {v(i)}(i is an element of I) of V is called multiplicative with respect to the basis B similar to = {wj}(j is an element of J) of W if for any i is an element of I, j is an element of J we have either v(i)w(j) = 0 or 0 not equal v(i)w(j). Fv(k) for some k is an element of I. We show that if V admits a multiplicative basis in the above sense then it decomposes as the direct sum V = circle plus V-alpha(alpha) of well-described submodules admitting each one a multiplicative basis. Also, under a mild condition, the minimality of V is characterized in terms of the multiplicative basis and it is shown that the above direct sum is by means of the family of its minimal submodules, admitting each one a multiplicative basis. Some applications to the structure theory of arbitrary algebras with multiplicative bases, arbitrary algebraic pairs with multiplicative bases and modules over arbitrary algebras with multiplicative bases are also provided.

The mixing layer is generated upstream of the square cylinder by mixing two uniform streams of fluid with different velocities above and below the splitter plate. A range of upstream domain lengths, distances between the splitter plate and the square cylinder, and upstream velocity ratios between the two streams of fluid are analyzed. Unconfined flow over a square cylinder placed in uniform upstream flow is initially analyzed as it plays a crucial role in understanding the properties of the wake. The results are compared with the existing literature to validate the code developed and they are found to be in very good agreement. It is observed from the present study that at smaller velocity ratios, the vortices shed into the wake consist of both clockwise and anticlockwise moment vortices. As velocity ratio is increased only clockwise moment vortices are shed downstream and anticlockwise vortices are shed as Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities. In all simulations undertaken the same phenomena is observed independent of the upstream Reynolds number, indicating that velocity ratio is a primary parameter influencing the flow. Different instability modes were observed and they were highly dependent on the upstream velocity ratio.

The nanotube is assumed to be inscribed into a perfect cylinder of unknown diameter, which is estimated by minimizing the total interatomic potential involved into a basic cell with several carbon atoms and their corresponding bonds. In this step, two interatomic potentials have been adopted in order to compare their influence on the obtained results. Our calculations show that the widely used conformal mapping is not the most suitable option to reproduce the geometry of single-walled nanotubes in absence of external loading. Likewise, a more accurate method to estimate the initial diameter of the nanotube is developed, yielding higher differences with smaller nanotubes in comparison with other published works. The present analysis can be useful in the framework of molecular mechanics or continuum models as an alternative way to introduce initial stresses (due to the curvature of the cylinder) in the mechanical analysis, against other involved methods.

These represent a unique conductive material for deposition on adaptable nonconductive substrates. Single-walled and multi-walled carbon nanotubes as well as graphene scaffold film electrodes (SFEs) were designed, and their electroanalytical performance was evaluated by using two different designs. The first is a 3-electrode configuration for off-chip detection, and the second is one for on-chip detection of the biomarkers dopamine and catechol at +0.70 V detection potential (vs. Ag/AgCl). The SFEs were fabricated by filtration of conducting carbon nanomaterials using a tailored template. In our perception, they pave the way for a wide field of opportunities in off-chip and microfluidic electrochemistry because of their reliability, ease of fabrication and remarkable performance that is based on the exclusive use of the carbon nanomaterial transducers.

Fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4) is a key adipokine for fatty acid transport. In metabolic pathologies, plasma levels of FABP4 are increased. However, the role of this circulating protein is unknown. Recent studies have demonstrated that FABP4 might have a role in tumor progression, but the molecular mechanisms involved are still unclear. In this study, we analysed the role of eFABP4 (exogenous FABP4) in breast cancer progression. MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells did not express substantial levels of FABP4 protein, but intracellular FABP4 levels increased after eFABP4 incubation. Moreover, eFABP4 enhanced the proliferation of these breast cancer cells but did not have any effect on MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell migration. Additionally, eFABP4 induced the AKT and MAPK signaling cascades in breast cancer cells, and the inhibition of these pathways reduced the eFBAP4-mediated cell proliferation. Interestingly, eFABP4 treatment in MCF-7 cells increased levels of the transcription factor FoxM1 and the fatty acid transport proteins CD36 and FABP5. In summary, we showed that eFABP4 plays a key role in tumor proliferation and activates the expression of fatty acid transport proteins in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The latter were represented by set-ups placed inside hydrophobic graphene slabs at the nanometric scale allocating a few water layers, namely one or two in the narrowest case. Water-proton and carbon-proton forces were modelled with a Multi-State Empirical Valence Bond method. As a general trend, a competition between the effects of confinement and temperature is observed on the local hydrogen-bonded structures around the lone proton and, consequently, on the mean force exerted by its environment on the water molecule carrying the proton. Free energy barriers estimated from the computed potentials of mean force tend to rise with the combined effect of increasing temperatures and the packing effect due to a larger extent of hydrophobic confinement. The main reason observed for such enhancement of the free energy barriers was the breaking of the second coordination shell around the lone proton.

In applications, platinum-based catalysts give ideal reactivity, but, in practice, are often subject to high costs and poor stability. Some cost-efficient transition metal oxides have exhibited excellent ORR reactivity, but the stability and durability of such alternative catalyst materials pose serious challenges. Here, we present a facile method to fabricate uniform Co (x) O (y) nanoparticles and embed them into N-doped carbon, which results in a composite of extraordinary stability and durability, while maintaining its high reactivity. The half-wave potential shows a negative shift of only 21 mV after 10,000 cycles, only one third of that observed for Pt/C (63 mV). Furthermore, after 100,000 s testing at a constant potential, the current decreases by only 17%, significantly less than for Pt/C (35%). The exceptional stability and durability results from the system architecture, which comprises a thin carbon shell that prevents agglomeration of the Co (x) O (y) nanoparticles and their detaching from the substrate.

These are initiated from founder cells, triggering new formative divisions that generate lateral root primordia (LRP). The LRP size and shape depends on the balance between positive and negative signals that control cell proliferation. The mechanisms controlling proliferation potential of LRP cells remains poorly understood. We found that Arabidopsis thaliana MYB36, which have been previously shown to regulate genes required for Casparian strip formation and the transition from proliferation to differentiation in the primary root, plays a new role in controlling LRP development at later stages. We found that MYB36 is a novel component of LR development at later stages. MYB36 was expressed in the cells surrounding LRP where it controls a set of peroxidase genes, which maintain reactive oxygen species (ROS) balance. This was required to define the transition between proliferating and arrested cells inside the LRP, coinciding with the change from flat to dome-shaped primordia. Reducing the levels of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in myb36-5 significantly rescues the mutant phenotype. Our results uncover a role for MYB36 outside the endodermis during LRP development through a mechanism analogous to regulating the proliferation/differentiation transition in the root meristem.

Invasive species' leaf traits and dissimilarity from natives shape their impact on nitrogen cycling: a meta-analysis	NEW PHYTOLOGIST			English	Article						functional trait; leaf carbon to nitrogen; leaf nitrogen content; mineralization; nitrogen cycling; nutrient-use strategy; plant invasions	PLANT ECONOMICS SPECTRUM; PHOTOSYNTHETIC CAPACITY; FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY; DECOMPOSITION RATES; ROOT TRAITS; DRY MASS; LITTER; ECOSYSTEMS; PHOSPHORUS; COMMUNITY	Many exotic species have little apparent impact on ecosystem processes, whereas others have dramatic consequences for human and ecosystem health. There is growing evidence that invasions foster eutrophication. We need to identify species that are harmful and systems that are vulnerable to anticipate these consequences. Species' traits may provide the necessary insights. We conducted a global meta-analysis to determine whether plant leaf and litter functional traits, and particularly leaf and litter nitrogen (N) content and carbon: nitrogen (C : N) ratio, explain variation in invasive species' impacts on soil N cycling. Dissimilarity in leaf and litter traits among invaded and noninvaded plant communities control the magnitude and direction of invasion impacts on N cycling. Invasions that caused the greatest increases in soil inorganic N and mineralization rates had a much greater litter N content and lower litter C : N in the invaded than the reference community. Trait dissimilarities were better predictors than the trait values of invasive species alone. Quantifying baseline community tissue traits, in addition to those of the invasive species, is critical to understanding the impacts of invasion on soil N cycling.

Arabidopsis thaliana root colonization by the nematophagous fungus Pochonia chlamydosporia is modulated by jasmonate signaling and leads to accelerated flowering and improved yield	NEW PHYTOLOGIST			English	Article						Arabidopsis thaliana; flowering time; growth promotion; jasmonate (JA); Pochonia chlamydosporia; stress response	HORDEUM-VULGARE ROOTS; MELOIDOGYNE-JAVANICA; PIRIFORMOSPORA-INDICA; NEMATODE INFECTION; PLANT-GROWTH; LOCUS-C; ENDOPHYTIC COLONIZATION; MYCORRHIZAL SYMBIOSES; MICROBE INTERACTIONS; FUSARIUM-EQUISETI	Pochonia chlamydosporia has been intensively studied in nematode control of different crops. We have investigated the interaction between P. chlamydosporia and the model system Arabidopsis thaliana under laboratory conditions in the absence of nematodes. This study demonstrates that P. chlamydosporia colonizes A. thaliana. Root colonization monitored with green fluorescent protein-tagged P. chlamydosporia and quantitative PCR (qPCR) quantitation methods revealed root cell invasion. Fungal inoculation reduced flowering time and stimulated plant growth, as determined by total FW increase, faster development of inflorescences and siliques, and a higher yield in terms of seed production per plant. Precocious flowering was associated with significant expression changes in key floweringtime genes. In addition, we also provided molecular and genetic evidence that point towards jasmonate signaling as an important factor to modulate progression of plant colonization by the fungus. Our results indicate that P. chlamydosporia provides benefits to the plant in addition to its nematophagous activity. This report highlights the potential of P. chlamydosporia to improve yield in economically important crops.

Design of a variable width pulse generator feasible for manual or automatic control	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Pulse generation; Signal on transition; Variable width	TELESCOPE	A variable width pulse generator featuring more than 4-V peak amplitude and less than 10-ns FWHM is described. In this design the width of the pulses is controlled by means of the control signal slope. Thus, a variable transition time control circuit (TTCC) is also developed, based on the charge and discharge of a capacitor by means of two tunable current sources. Additionally, it is possible to activate/deactivate the pulses when required, therefore allowing the creation of any desired pulse pattern. Furthermore, the implementation presented here can be electronically controlled. In conclusion, due to its versatility, compactness and low cost it can be used in a wide variety of applications.

In this work, the response of the red palm weevil (RPW), Rhynchophorus ferrugineus Olivier, to increasing emission rates of its aggregation pheromone (ferrugineol) and the efficacy of a convenient synthetic kairomone based on fermentation odours (ethyl acetate and ethanol) have been evaluated in different years and locations along the Mediterranean basin. RESULTSIn general, although capture data and emission had noticeable variability among locations, significantly fewer RPW were captured in pyramidal Picusan (R) traps with the lowest ferrugineol emission rates tested (0.6-3.8 mg day(-1)). Captures increased rapidly with ferrugineol emission up to 4-5 mg day(-1); then, higher emission rates did not improve or reduce captures, up to the highest emission rate tested of 50.9 mg day(-1). Thus, there is no evidence of an optimum release rate corresponding to a maximum of RPW catches. Traps baited with the synthetic kairomone (1:3 ethyl acetate/ethanol) captured 1.4-2.2 times more total weevils than traps baited only with ferrugineol. Moreover, in most of the locations, the synthetic blend was at least as effective as the local coattractants used (plant material + molasses). CONCLUSIONSFerrugineol emission rate can vary in a wide range without significantly affecting RPW response. Coattractants based on fermenting compounds, ethyl acetate and ethanol, are able to improve the attractant level of ferrugineol and could be employed to replace non-standardised natural kairomones in RPW trapping systems after further optimisation of their proportions and doses.

Germination sensitivity to water stress in four shrubby species across the Mediterranean Basin	PLANT BIOLOGY			English	Article						Cistaceae; Erica arborea; Fabaceae; fire cues; heat shock; hydrotime analysis; PEG; smoke	SEED-GERMINATION; OSMOTIC-STRESS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; INTRASPECIFIC VARIABILITY; 5 PROVENANCES; TRAITS; TEMPERATURE; FIRE; AVAILABILITY; DYNAMICS	Mediterranean shrublands are generally water-limited and fire-driven ecosystems. Seed-based post-fire regeneration may be affected by varying rainfall patterns, depending on species sensitivity to germinate under water stress. In our study, we considered the germination response to water stress in four species from several sites across the Mediterranean Basin. Seeds of species with a hard coat (Cistus monspeliensis, C.salviifolius, Cistaceae, Calicotome villosa, Fabaceae) or soft coat (Erica arborea, Ericaceae), which were exposed or not to a heat shock and smoke (fire cues), were made to germinate under water stress. Final germination percentage, germination speed and viability of seeds were recorded. Germination was modelled using hydrotime analysis and correlated to the water balance characteristics of seed provenance. Water stress was found to decrease final germination in the three hard-seeded species, as well as reduce germination speed. Moreover, an interaction between fire cues and water stress was found, whereby fire cues increased sensitivity to water stress. Seed viability after germination under water stress also declined in two hard-seeded species. Conversely, E.arborea showed little sensitivity to water stress, independent of fire cues. Germination responses varied among populations of all species, and hydrotime parameters were not correlated to site water balance, except in E.arborea when not exposed to fire cues. In conclusion, the species studied differed in germination sensitivity to water stress; furthermore, fire cues increased this sensitivity in the three hard-seeded species, but not in E.arborea. Moreover, populations within species consistently differed among themselves, but these differences could only be related to the provenance locality in E.arborea in seeds not exposed to fire cues.

Comparative seed germination traits in alpine and subalpine grasslands: higher elevations are associated with warmer germination temperatures	PLANT BIOLOGY			English	Article						Altitude; functional traits; germination temperature; high-mountain flora; phylogenetic comparative methods; phylogenetic generalised least squares; physiological seed dormancy	CLIMATE-CHANGE; PLANTS; DORMANCY; COMMUNITIES; DISPERSAL; GRADIENTS; EVOLUTION; RESPONSES; AREAS; WILL	Seed germination traits in alpine grasslands are poorly understood, despite the sensitivity of these communities to climate change. We hypothesise that germination traits predict species occurrence along the alpine-subalpine elevation gradient. Phylogenetic comparative analyses were performed using fresh seeds of 22 species from alpine and subalpine grasslands (1600-2400m) of the Cantabrian Mountains, Spain (43 degrees N, 5 degrees W). Laboratory experiments were conducted to characterise germinability, optimum germination temperature and effect of cold and warm stratification on dormancy breaking. Variability in these traits was reduced by phylogenetic principal component analysis (phyl.PCA). Phylogenetic generalised least squares regression (PGLS) was used to fit a model in which species average elevation was predicted from their position on the PCA axes. Most subalpine species germinated in snow-like conditions, whereas most alpine species needed accumulation of warm temperatures. Phylogenetic signal was low. PCA1 ordered species according to overall germinability, whilst PCA2 ordered them according to preference for warm or cold germination. PCA2 significantly predicted species occurrence in the alpine-subalpine gradient, as higher elevation species tended to have warmer germination preferences. Our results show that germination traits in high-mountain grasslands are closely linked to the alpine-subalpine gradient. Alpine species, especially those from stripped and wind-edge communities, prefer warmer germination niches, suggesting that summer emergence prevents frost damage during seedling establishment. In contrast, alpine snowfield and subalpine grassland plants have cold germination niches, indicating that winter emergence may occur under snow to avoid drought stress.

Dormancy induction by summer temperatures and/or desiccation in imbibed seeds of trumpet daffodils Narcissus alcaracensis and N.longispathus (Amaryllidaceae)	PLANT BIOLOGY			English	Article						Complex morphophysiological dormancy; secondary dormancy; warm stratification; water stress	FLOWERING GALANTHUS-NIVALIS; MORPHOPHYSIOLOGICAL DORMANCY; EMBRYO GROWTH; ENVIRONMENTAL-REGULATION; GERMINATION ECOLOGY; IBERIAN DAFFODIL; APIACEAE; ECOPHYSIOLOGY; MORPHOLOGY; EVOLUTION	We analysed the effects of summer temperatures (28/14 degrees C) and/or desiccation (from 48% to 8% humidity) on imbibed Narcissus alcaracensis and N.longispathus seeds with an elongating embryo. In the N.alcaracensis seeds that overcame dormancy (embryo elongation=27.14%), exposure to high temperatures induced secondary dormancy and reduced subsequent embryo growth. A further 3-month cold stratification (5 degrees C) was required to break secondary dormancy. Desiccation in early embryo growth stages (elongation=11.42%) also reduced germination. Desiccation in the seeds in a more advanced growth stage (i.e. embryo elongation=27.14%) induced secondary dormancy, which the further 3-month cold stratification did not overcome. When desiccation was preceded by high temperatures, seeds better overcame secondary dormancy (i.e. longer embryo elongation and seed germination). Treatments did not affect seed viability. In the N.longispathus seeds that overcame dormancy (embryo elongation=59.21%), exposure to high temperatures induced secondary dormancy and they needed a further 1-month stratification at 15/4 degrees C+2months at 5 degrees C to reactivate the germination process. When embryo elongation was 42.10%, seed desiccation totally impeded subsequent germination. When embryo elongation reached 59.21%, desiccation induced secondary dormancy, which was not overcome by the above-described stratification treatment. When desiccation was preceded by high temperatures, seeds better overcame dormancy. Stress treatments killed 5-10% of seeds. This study suggests that the seeds of species with complex morphophysiological dormancy (MPD) levels are sensitive to desiccation in early embryo development stages, as opposed to the seeds of species with deep simple epicotyl MPD, which better tolerate water stress.

Terpenoid trans-caryophyllene inhibits weed germination and induces plant water status alteration and oxidative damage in adult Arabidopsis	PLANT BIOLOGY			English	Article						Chlorophyll a fluorescence; natural herbicide; phytotoxicity; plant stress; sesquiterpene; weed management	OSMOTIC-STRESS; ESSENTIAL OILS; LEAF EXTRACTS; CHLOROPHYLL FLUORESCENCE; PHYTOTOXIC ACTIVITY; ENERGY-DISSIPATION; BETA-CARYOPHYLLENE; EXCITATION-ENERGY; XANTHOPHYLL CYCLE; HERBICIDE MODELS	trans-Caryophyllene (TC) is a sesquiterpene commonly found as volatile component in many different aromatic plants. Although the phytotoxic effects of trans-caryophyllene on seedling growth are relatively explored, not many information is available regarding the phytotoxicity of this sesquiterpenes on weed germination and on adult plants. The phytotoxic potential of TC was assayed in vitro on weed germination and seedling growth to validate its phytotoxic potential on weed species. Moreover, it was assayed on the metabolism of Arabidopsis thaliana adult plants, through two different application ways, spraying and watering, in order to establish the primary affected organ and to deal with the unknown mobility of the compound. The results clearly indicated that TC inhibited both seed germination and root growth, as demonstrated by comparison of the ED50 values. Moreover, although trans-caryophyllene-sprayed adult Arabidopsis plants did not show any effect, trans-caryophyllene-watered plants became strongly affected. The results suggested that root uptake was a key step for the effectiveness of this natural compound and its phytotoxicity on adult plants was mainly due to the alteration of plant water status accompanied by oxidative damage.

R.; Comesana, Montserrat; Soares, Ana Paula			Disentangling the effects of word frequency and contextual diversity on serial recall performance	QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Serial memory; Serial recall; Contextual diversity; Word frequency	SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; ORDER INFORMATION; FILM SUBTITLES; RECOGNITION; MODEL; ITEM; ACQUISITION; SPEECH; COOCCURRENCE; VARIABILITY	Research shows that contextual diversity (CD; the number of different contexts in which a word appears within a corpus) constitutes a better predictor of reading performance than word frequency (WF), that it mediates the access to lexical representations, and that controlling for contextual CD abolishes the effect of WF in lexical decision tasks. Despite the theoretical relevance of these findings for the study of serial memory, it is not known how CD might affect serial recall performance. We report the first independent manipulation of CD and WF in a serial recall task. Experiment 1 revealed better performance for low CD and for high WF words independently. Both effects affected omissions and item errors, but contrary to past research, word frequency also affected order errors. These results were confirmed in two more experiments comparing pure and alternating lists of low and high CD (Experiment 2) or WF (Experiment 3). The effect of CD was immune to this manipulation, while that of WF was abolished in alternating lists. Altogether the findings suggest a more difficult episodic retrieval of item information for words of high CD, and a role for both item and order information in the WF effect.	[Parmentier, Fabrice B.

Evidence from a cross-dialect investigation	QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Cross-dialect variation; Accented speech; Speech perception; Spoken word recognition; Very early and proficient bilinguals	SPOKEN WORD RECOGNITION; PHONEMIC CONTRASTS; MISSING INFORMATION; NONNATIVE DIALECT; VOWEL PERCEPTION; ENGLISH; REPRESENTATION; ASSIMILATION; CONSONANTS; ACCENT	Accented speech has been seen as an additional impediment for speech processing; it usually adds linguistic and cognitive load to the listener's task. In the current study we analyse where the processing costs of regional dialects come from, a question that has not been answered yet. We quantify the proficiency of Basque-Spanish bilinguals who have different native dialects of Basque on many dimensions and test for costs at each of three levels of processing-phonemic discrimination, word recognition, and semantic processing. The ability to discriminate a dialect-specific contrast is affected by a bilingual's linguistic background less than lexical access is, and an individual's difficulty in lexical access is correlated with basic discrimination problems. Once lexical access is achieved, dialectal variation has little impact on semantic processing. The results are discussed in terms of the presence or absence of correlations between different processing levels. The implications of the results are considered for how models of spoken word recognition handle dialectal variation.

J	Rodriguez, G; Hall, G				Rodriguez, Gabriel; Hall, Geoffrey			Human latent inhibition and the density of predictive relationships in the context in which the target stimulus occurs	QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Latent inhibition; Stimulus salience; Associability; Context	CS	In two experiments, participants were exposed to a listing of actions performed by a fictitious Mr. X, over three days of his life. For most of his actions an outcome was described, but some were not followed by any outcome. On Day 3, Mr. X performed an action (the target action) that was followed by a novel outcome. For participants in the control condition, the target action that preceded the appearance of this outcome was also novel; for participants in the latent inhibition (LI) condition, Mr. X had performed the target action on repeated occasions during Days 2 and 3, without it producing any outcome. All the participants were tested on their ability to retrieve the action performed by Mr. X prior to the target outcome. In Experiment 1, retrieval of the target action (indicating a less effective target action-outcome association) was poorer in the LI than in the control condition. In Experiment 2, reducing the proportion (the density) of nontarget actions that brought outcomes during initial training was found to reduce the size of the LI effect. These results are predicted by the account of LI put forward previously [Hall, G., & Rodriguez, G. (2010). Associative and nonassociative processes in latent inhibition: An elaboration of the Pearce-Hall model. In R. E. Lubow & I. Weiner (Eds.), Latent inhibition: Data, theories, and applications to schizophrenia (pp. 114-136). Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press]. A high density of predictive relationships ensures strong activation of the expectancy that some outcome will occur when the target action is first presented; this facilitates the formation of a target action-no-event association during training in the LI condition, thus enhancing the LI effect.

The ways in which these representations are developed and their resistance to decay are hotly debated topics. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of semantic and phonological representations on the formation of orthographic representations in a transparent orthography. In order to achieve this objective, an experiment with three conditions was carried out. In the first condition, a group of university students were asked to repeatedly read 10 new words after semantic and phonological training, in the second condition another group of participants read the new words after phonological training, and in the third condition participants read without previous training. Finally, a follow-up session was performed to test the resistance to decay of the orthographic representations. The results showed that participants who had received semantic training formed the representations faster than participants in the other conditions, as indicated by the decrease in length effect. These results indicate the important role of previous knowledge when people face new written words. A month later these orthographic representations still remained in the lexicon of the participants.

J	Rodriguez, MAB				Barrios Rodriguez, Maria Auxiliadora			Contrived neologism: Lexicological study of Spanish neologisms	RILCE-REVISTA DE FILOLOGIA HISPANICA			Spanish	Article						Terminology implantation; Neologism; Euphemism; Lexicology; Collocations; Meaning-Text Theory		In this paper we study a type of neologism, which we call neologismo inducido (contrived neologism), and try to analyse some of those that were created in the last thirty years in Spain. We use the lexicological tools proposed by the Meaning-Text Theory in order to define their characteristics. Such neologisms are motivated by social changes that involve new concepts and demand new terminology. Sometimes by these neologisms people try to change social attitudes towards some social realities. This is the case of disabled, a term that replaced subnormal. In these cases, the new word contributes to the loss of the negative connotations that the previous word had acquired. This kind of neologism is subtly different from planned neologisms motivated as the result of a legislative change, such as parent A and parent B. Both words are used in Spain in birth certificates after the legalization of gay marriage as a means to avoid resorting to father and mother. What is special here is that induced neologisms follow an induced process, similar to terminology implantation; nevertheless only some of these neologisms are assimilated in everyday speech. The analysis shows that the more a neologism involves semantic change and preserves certain formal characteristics, the more likely it is to be assimilated.

Attenuation in Madrid: Socio-pragmatic patterns	RILCE-REVISTA DE FILOLOGIA HISPANICA			Spanish	Article						Attenuation; Sociolinguistic variation; Pragmatics; Social factors; PRESEEA Corpus		The study of attenuation has experienced a considerable but still limited development in the last decades. It has been tackled, especially, within the disciplines that work with the spoken language, such as pragmatics or discourse analysis, which have broadened the scope of study. So far, one of the least addressed issues in the use of attenuation strategies in Spanish is the variation conditioned by social factors. Hence, with the final aim of gaining deeper knowledge about the use Spanish speakers make of attenuation devices, the discursive functions these fulfill and the incidence that given social factors (e.g. gender, age and level of instruction) have on their use, solid sociopragmatic research is being carried out within the framework of the research project entitled "Sociolinguist Study on the Spanish from Spain and Latin America Project (PRESEEA)". In this article the more significant results obtained after the analysis of the Madrid corpus and the more relevant conclusions reached are presented.

Our aim is carrying out a descriptive analysis about the emergence and main functions of pues in early child language, as well as proposing a system of categories that can be used to its codification. Following an observational approach, we have examined the spontaneous speech of ten Spanish-speaking children (aged 2; 0-4; 0), and have tracked the uses of pues over a period of twelve months. We have used transcripts that belong to the Koine Corpus, included in the international CHILDES database. The study conducted shows that pues scarcely appears at preschool age, occurring approximately at age 3; 0 constricted to pragmatic functions.

A corpus of books was selected from the early classic Mesoamerican period to examine the Nahuatl, Purepecha, Zapotec and Mixtec traditions. For the analysis of these books, a historiographical approach was used to emphasize the importance of the agent in the linguistic production and the epistemological relevance of the transtextuality phenomena, focusing particularly on the paratext. The analysis of the general conceptions about language and native languages, which are documented in the texts analyzed from the period of the missionary linguistics, leads to the setting of a number of statements shared by the missionaries under scrutiny with its main arguments (primarily scriptural), images and examples.

For this reason, his literary work requires an interdisciplinary approach. The critics of his time considered his plays to be the result of an unlimited or extreme imagination. However, Echegaray argues that he uses rigorous deductive procedures in his plays and that he does not deviate from the artistic and scientific trends of his time that sought to explore social issues. In fact, the influence of the French economist Frederic Bastiat and the literature on Free Trade of the time are clearly present in his plays and can help us to understand and explain some of the procedures and reasoning that Echegaray uses in his plays.

J	Perez, RG				Garcia Perez, Rafael			Semantics in a historical dictionary: the lexicographic representation of the Spanish adjective inteligente	RILCE-REVISTA DE FILOLOGIA HISPANICA			Spanish	Article						Lexicography; Historical Dictionary; Semantics; Adjective; Definition		Researches in Lexical Semantics have demonstrated that word meanings are not homogenous. Unfortunately, lexicographers usually omit this issue, as they make use of a rigid lexicographic shape based on the fragmentation of meaning in senses and, in some cases, senses and subsenses. Taking the Spanish adjective "inteligente" as an example, we show that its unsatisfactory semantic representation in most of the dictionaries is due to the fact that its syntactic-semantic behaviour and its historical evolution have not been sufficiently taken into account. After analyzing the syntactic-semantic behaviour of this adjective throughout history, we find important qualitative semantic differences enabling a more coherent organization of its senses into a hierarchy. The results of our theoretical analysis are finally captured in a specific proposal for a definition of the adjective "inteligente" in a historical dictionary.

Meanwhile, Kant's classification of fine arts grants literature a privileged position, given the proximity that the linguistic means provide with the relation between intuition and concept. This article incorporates these considerations into the sphere of the reading experience, showing how the pleasure this generates goes beyond simple delight to eventually identify itself with the enigmatic, imaginative activity that is able to conceive a second nature.

RILCE-REVISTA DE FILOLOGIA HISPANICA			Spanish	Article						Witchcraft; Literature; Pamphlet; Mongaston; Auto de Fe (1610)		This article focuses on the pamphlet printed by Juan de Mongaston in 1611 about Logrono's Auto de Fe (1610) and its special emphasis on the witches judged on 7 and 8 November. This paper maintains that this pamphlet, which is of undeniable historical interest, must be approached from a literary perspective, since, as will be shown, it is actually a literary text, although it has never been viewed from that perspective. To justify these claims we will rely on the connection established by Francisco Rico and Jose Miguel Barandiaran, and the current narrative interpretation of witchcraft (Dolan, Rowland, Rowlands, Gibson, Clark, Rushton, Gaskill, Purkiss and Gentilcore) as well as contributions by Caro Baroja, Henningsen, Dueso and Azurmendi about the "Zugarramurdi's Witches".

Starting from the consideration that such opinions or comments are narratives of travel experiences, we have tried to characterize them in order to show their similarities and specificities with other types of narratives. To this end, we have set some of the basic patterns of the narrative as its structure, the construction of narrative power and temporality. Finally, we have proposed the classification of these texts within a macro-genre, describing its peculiarities.

J	Mestres, BM				Morros Mestres, Bienvenido			Enrique Gil and Byron	RILCE-REVISTA DE FILOLOGIA HISPANICA			Spanish	Article						Poetry and novel of the 19th Century; Comparative literature; Translation; Medicine and literary topics		This paper shows conclusively that Enrique Gil y Carrasco made deliberate use of Lord Byron's Don Juan for his historical novel, El Senor de Bembibre (Madrid, 1844). The most critical item to support this hypothesis is the aneurysm suffered both by Haidee and Beatriz, which discards almost definitely the possibility that the heroine of the Bierzo dies as a result of a tuberculosis. The context in which the authors have framed the lethal accident of their characters helps reaffirm the influence of the English poem on the Spanish novel: the unexpected arrival of their respective fathers for very different reasons (Haidee's father puts an end to her happiness, Beatriz's restores hers). Gil y Carrasco makes use of the anonymous Spanish translation, derived from the French one by Amadeo Pichot.

J	Ponce, MIR				Rodriguez Ponce, Maria Isabel			The academic discourse of John L. Austin: linguistic aspects in the light of rhetoric	RILCE-REVISTA DE FILOLOGIA HISPANICA			Spanish	Article						Discourse Analysis; Academic Discourse; Linguistic Metahistoriography; Philosophy of Ordinary Language; Rhetoric	LANGUAGE	This paper analyses some grammatical aspects of John L. Austin's discourse in How to Do Things with Words (1962), with the aim to show that discursive forms can structure the paradigm of a linguistic theory, and not just represent it. This study applies Discourse Analysis to Linguistic Metahistoriography as a theoretical and methodological framework. In a first step, some reflections are made on the nature of academic discourse in human sciences, in order to check how it is influenced by the models of experimental sciences, particularly with regard to the preeminence of objetivism and the rejection of stylistic and rhetoric resources. Secondly, the analysis of morphosyntactic and lexical features in Austin (verbs, interrogative sentences, idioms, etc.) allows us to observe that this philosopher of language points out the subjective style in academic discourse. In this way he breaks with the objectivist myth and gives to his work a unique coherence between content and form.

Lead and PAHs contamination of an old shooting range: A case study with a holistic approach	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Bioaccumulation; Contaminated soil; Ecotoxicological tests; Earthworms; Risk assessment; Tiers 1 and 2	POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC-HYDROCARBONS; HUMAN HEALTH-RISKS; SOIL PROPERTIES; POLLUTED SOILS; ACUTE TOXICITY; ORGANIC POLLUTANTS; METAL ACCUMULATION; FOLSOMIA-CANDIDA; HEAVY-METALS; FIRING RANGE	Soil pollution at firing ranges is an issue of growing importance, due to the accumulation in soils of contaminants derived from ammunition and clay targets. The concentration of Pb and PAHs was determined in five soils of an abandoned shooting range in Galicia (northwest Spain), and an ecotoxicological characterization was performed in order to obtain an assessment of risks. Therefore, the retention capacity of soils was assessed using test organisms of different trophic levels, and the role of soils as habitat for soil invertebrates was assessed by reproduction tests and bioaccumulation assays with earthworms. The sum of 15 PAHs ranged between 38 and 360 mg kg(-1), which exceed, together with Pb (160-720 mg kg(-1)), the Galician generic reference value for urban and sporting field soils. Bioaccumulation in E. andrei showed contents up to 104,000 mu g Pb kg(dw)(-1), and up to 645 mu g PAHs kg(fw)(-1). High contents of Pb and PAHs in soil samples and in Eisenia andrei whole body, caused a reduction in the number of juveniles produced, whereas, Vibrio fischeri, Raphidocelis subcapitata and Daphniamagna displayed a slight toxic response to the soil elutriates tested. Therefore, the function of these soils to retain contaminants seemed not compromised, probably due to the high organic matter content and pH values, which are weakly acidic. The habitat function was affected, indicating that soil solution is not the only route of exposure to contaminants to E. andrei. The integration of chemical and ecotoxicological lines of evidence give rise to high risks values, restricting the use of these areas, and pointing for risks to surrounding ecosystems due to possible trophic transferences. The calculation of risks using the chemical and ecotoxicological data, required by Spanish legislation, could be a good approach to communicate with those responsible and/or involved in the management of contaminated sites.

Seasonal changes in antioxidative/oxidative profile of mining and non-mining populations of Syrian beancaper as determined by soil conditions	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Zygophyllum fabago; Antioxidative/oxidative profiles; Mine tailings piles; Mediterranean climate; Biomarkers	BETA-CARBOLINE ALKALOIDS; ABIOTIC STRESS TOLERANCE; INDUCED OXIDATIVE STRESS; ACINETOBACTER SP ADP1; HEAVY-METAL STRESS; SALICYLIC-ACID; MINE TAILINGS; PHENOLIC-COMPOUNDS; ANTIOXIDANT PROPERTIES; CONTAMINATED SOILS	Soil pollution by heavy metals/metalloids (HMMs) is a problem worldwide. To prevent dispersion of contaminated particles by erosion, the maintenance of a vegetative cover is needed. Successful plant establishment in multi-polluted soils can be hampered not only by HMM toxicities, but also by soil nutrient deficiencies and the co-occurrence of abiotic stresses. Some plant species are able to thrive under these multi-stress scenarios often linked to marked fluctuations in environmental factors. This study aimed to investigate the metabolic adjustments involved in Zygophyllum fabago acclimative responses to conditions prevailing in HMM-enriched mine-tailings piles, during Mediterranean spring and summer. To this end, fully expanded leaves, and rhizosphere soil, of three contrasting mining and non-mining populations of Z. fabago grown spontaneously in south-eastern Spain were sampled in two consecutive years. Approximately 50 biochemical, physiological and edaphic parameters were examined, including leaf redox components, primary and secondary metabolites, endogenous levels of salicylic acid, and physicochemical properties of soil (fertility parameters and total concentration of HMMs). Multivariate data analysis showed a clear distinction in antioxidative/oxidative profiles between and within the populations studied. Levels of chlorophylls, proteins and proline characterized control plants whereas antioxidant capacity and C-and S-based antioxidant compounds were biomarkers of mining plants. Seasonal variations were characterized by higher levels of alkaloids and PAL and soluble peroxidase activities in summer, and by soluble sugars and hydroxycinnamic acids in spring irrespective of the population considered. Although the antioxidant systems are subjected to seasonal variations, the way and the intensity with which every population changes its antioxidative/oxidative profile seem to be determined by soil conditions. In short, Z. fabago displays a high physiological plasticity that allow it to successfully shift its metabolism to withstand the multiple stresses that plants must cope with in mine tailings piles under Mediterranean climatic conditions.

These MSUs allow AQ measurements in many new applications, such as ambulatory exposure analyses and citizen science. Typically, the performance of these devices is assessed using the mean error or correlation coefficients with respect to a laboratory equipment. However, these criteria do not represent how such sensors perform outside of laboratory conditions in large-scale field applications, and do not cover all aspects of possible differences in performance between the sensor-based and standardized equipment, or changes in performance over time. This paper presents a comprehensive Sensor Evaluation Toolbox (SET) for evaluating AQ MSUs by a range of criteria, to better assess their performance in varied applications and environments. Within the SET are included four new schemes for evaluating sensors' capability to: locate pollution sources; represent the pollution level on a coarse scale; capture the high temporal variability of the observed pollutant and their reliability. Each of the evaluation criteria allows for assessing sensors' performance in a different way, together constituting a holistic evaluation of the suitability and usability of the sensors in a wide range of applications. Application of the SET on measurements acquired by 25MSUs deployed in eight cities across Europe showed that the suggested schemes facilitates a comprehensive cross platform analysis that can be used to determine and compare the sensors' performance. The SET was implemented in R and the code is available on the first author's website. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Its utility for end-users is assessed through the analysis of economic value curve areas (EVA). Firstly, we have built monthly multiple linear regression (MLR) models for the in-flow, out-flow and volume anomalies by identifying the underlying relationships between these predictands and their potential predictors, both meteorological and human influenced: rainfall, maximum and minimum temperatures, reservoir volume and discharge. Subsequently, we have forecast the monthly anomalies with these models for the period 1981-2010 (up to seven months ahead). We have tested the aforementioned models with four strategies in a leave-one-out cross-validation procedure (LOOCV): a) Climatology (Clim.), b) persistence (Pers.), c) antecedent observations + climatology (A + Clim.), d) antecedent observations + European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) System 4 anomalies (A + S4). Climatology is the operational strategy against which the other approximations are compared. The second and third approaches only use observations as input data. Finally, the last one combines both observations and ECMWF System 4 forecasts. The LOOCV revealed that reservoir volume is the variable best described by the MLR models, followed by in-flow and out-flow anomalies. In the case of volume anomalies, the predictability displayed provides added value with respect to climatology with a minimum of four months in advance. For in-flow and out-flow this is true at one month ahead, and regarding the latter variable we encounter enhanced predictability also at longer horizons for the summer months, when water demands peak (a valuable result for end-users). Hence, there is a window of opportunity to develop future operational frameworks that could outperform the use of climatology for these variables and forecast horizons. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

J	Arauzo, M				Arauzo, Mercedes			Vulnerability of groundwater resources to nitrate pollution: A simple and effective procedure for delimiting Nitrate Vulnerable Zones	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Diffuse pollution; Hydrogeological factors; Land use; Nitrates Directive	AQUIFER VULNERABILITY; DRASTIC MODEL; GIS; IMPLEMENTATION; VALIDATION; REGION; SPAIN	This research was undertaken to further our understanding of the factors involved in nonpoint-source nitrate pollution of groundwater. The shortcomings of some of the most commonly used methods for assessing groundwater vulnerability have been analysed and a new procedure that incorporates key improvements has been proposed. The new approach (LU-IV procedure) allows us to assess and map groundwater vulnerability to nitrate pollution and to accurately delimit the Nitrate Vulnerable Zones. The LU-IV procedure proved more accurate than the most widely used methods to assess groundwater vulnerability (DRASTIC, GOD), when compared with nitrate distribution in the groundwater of 46 aquifers included in the study (using the drainage basin as the unit of analysis). The proposed procedure stands out by meeting the following requirements: (1) it uses readily available parameters that provide enough data to feed the model, (2) it excludes redundant parameters, (3) it avoids the need to assign insufficiently contrasted weights to parameters, (4) it assess the whole catchment area that potentially drains N-polluted waters into the receptor aquifer, (5) it can be implemented within a GIS, and (6) it provides a multi-scale representation. As the LU-IV procedure has been demonstrated to be a reliable tool for delimiting NVZ, it could be particularly interesting to use it in countries where certain types of environmental data are either not available or have only limited availability. Based on this study (and according to the LU-IV procedure), it was concluded that an area of at least 1728 km(2) should be considered as NVZ. This sharply contrasts with the current 328 km2 officially designated in the study area by the Spain's regional administrations. These results highlight the need to redefine the current NVZ designation, which is essential for an appropriate implementation of action programmes designed to restore water quality in line with Directive 91/676/EEC.

Comparative study of the intake of toxic persistent and semi persistent pollutants through the consumption of fish and seafood from two modes of production (wild-caught and farmed)	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Organochlorine pesticides; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Heavy metals; Aquaculture	POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC-HYDROCARBONS; SALMON SALMO-SALAR; POLYBROMINATED DIPHENYL ETHERS; POLYCHLORINATED-BIPHENYLS; ORGANOCHLORINE PESTICIDES; SEA-BASS; ORGANOHALOGENATED CONTAMINANTS; ORGANIC POLLUTANTS; DIETARY PATTERNS; BRITISH-COLUMBIA	Adverse effects of chemical contaminants associated with seafood counteract the undoubted benefits for the health of its valuable nutrients. So much so that many dietary guidelines recommend no more than one serving a week of fish and seafood. Although is estimated that aquaculture provides more than 50% of the fish and seafood consumed globally, few research studies have focused in the assessment of the intake of pollutants through aquaculture products. In this study we determined the levels of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and toxic elements (Pb, Cd, Ni, Al, As, and Hg) in a large sample of farmed and wild-caught seafood, and we estimated the intake of these contaminants in two hypothetical models of consumers: those consuming only farmed fish, and those consuming only wild fish. Measured levels of most organic and many inorganic pollutants were higher in aquaculture products, and consequently intake levels if only such products were consumed would be also significantly higher. Thus, the intake of Sigma PAHs in adults consuming aquaculture seafood would be 3.30 ng/kg-bw/day, and consuming seafood from extractive fishing 2.41 ng/kg-bw/day (p < 0.05); Sigma OCPs, 3.36 vs. 1.85 ng/kg-bw/day, respectively (p < 0.05); Sigma PCBs, 2.35 vs. 2.11 ng/kg bw/day, respectively; and the intake of Pb, Ni, As, and Al would be also significantly higher consuming farmed seafood. For children the estimations were very similar, but the difference of intake of PCBs reached statistical significance. The implementation of several decontamination practices in aquaculture would allow not only match the levels of pollution from wild-caught seafood, but also could provide products with much lower levels of pollutants than those, which in turn would allow to increase consumption over the "one serving per week", and so benefit the consumer of the enormous positive health effects of the valuable nutrients of seafood.

SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Aerobiology; Pollen long-range transport; Source-receptor model; Birch pollen in Spain	LONG-RANGE TRANSPORT; SOURCE-RECEPTOR RELATIONSHIPS; GENE FLOW; SPAIN; PRECIPITATION; PATTERNS; MODEL; SENSITIVITY; POLLUTION; DENMARK	This work provides a first assessment of the possible barrier effect of the Pyrenees on the atmospheric transport of airborne pollen from Europe to the North of the Iberian Peninsula. Aerobiological data recorded in three Spanish stations located at the eastern, central and western base of the Pyrenees in the period 2004-2014 have been used to identify the possible long range transport episodes of Betula pollen. The atmospheric transport routes and the origin regions have been established by means of trajectory analysis and a source receptor model. Betula pollen outbreaks were associated with the meteorological scenario characterized by the presence of a high-pressure system overm over Morocco and Southern Iberian Peninsula. France and Central Europe have been identified as the probable source areas of Betula pollen that arrives to Northern Spain. However, the specific source areas are mainly determined by the particular prevailing atmospheric circulation of each location. Finally, the Weather Research and Forecasting model highlighted the effect of the orography on the atmospheric transport patterns, showing paths through the western and easternmost lowlands for Vitoria-Gasteiz and Bellaterra respectively, and the direct impact of air flows over Vielha through the Garona valley.

Considering the hypothesis that the biocrusts can be linked to vegetation through the arbuscular fungi mycelial network, the objectives proposed in this study were to determine (i) whether there are arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in the biocrusts (ii) whether arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal assemblages are linked to the Trachypogon patches, and (iii) whether the composition of the assemblages is related to soil properties affected by microbiological activity. The community structure of the AMF was investigated in three habitats: rhizospheric soil and roots of Trachypogon vestitus, biological soil crusts, and bare soil. The canonical correspondence analysis showed that two soil properties related to enzymatic activity (protease and beta-glucosidase) significantly affected the community composition of the AMF. The biocrusts in the Venezuelan savanna are colonized by an AM fungal community linked to that of the bare soil and significantly different from that hosted by the roots of the surrounding T. vestitus, suggesting that assemblages of AMF in biocrusts might be related more closely to those of annual plant species appearing in favorable conditions.

Their monitoring, management, and protection requirements differ from reservoirs situated in non-urbanized areas. The objectives of this study were: (a) to determine the concentrations of select pesticides and emerging pollutants (EPs) present in an urban reservoir; (b) to describe their possible spatial distributions; and (c) to quantify the risks for aquatic life and safeguard drinking water supplies. For this purpose, the Guarapiranga reservoir was studied as an example of a multi-stressed urban reservoir in a tropical region. A total of 31 organic compounds (including pesticides, illicit drugs, pharmaceuticals, and endocrine disruptors) were analyzed twice over a period of one year, together with classical indicators of water quality. The physical and chemical data were treated using principal component analysis (PCA) to identify possible temporal or spatial patterns. Risk assessment was performed for biota and drinking water use, comparing maximum environmental concentrations (MECs) with the predicted no-effect concentrations (PNECs) or drinking water quality criteria (DWC), respectively. The results demonstrated the presence of pesticides and EPs, as well as pollution by high levels of nutrients and Chlorophyll a (Chl. a), during the study period. The nutrients and Trophic State Index (TSI) showed gradients in the reservoir and regional distributions, while the pesticides and EPs only clearly showed this pattern in the dry season. The concentrations and distributions of the pesticides and EPs therefore showed seasonality. These findings suggested that the two groups of pollutants (EPs+ pesticides and nutrients) possessed different sources and behavior and were not always correlated in the reservoir studied. In the studied period, no risk was observed in raw water for drinking water use, but carbendazim, imidacloprid, and BPA showed risks for the biota in the reservoir. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The heartworm (Dirofilaria immitis) seems to be able to metabolize organochlorine pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls: A case-control study in dogs	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Polychlorinated biphenyls; Organochlorine pesticides; Dirofilariasis; Host-parasite interactions; Canines	POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC-HYDROCARBONS; PERSISTENT ORGANIC POLLUTANTS; CANARY-ISLANDS SPAIN; BULLROUT MYOXOCEPHALUS-SCORPIUS; NEMATODE CAENORHABDITIS-ELEGANS; HEAVY-METAL CONCENTRATIONS; PET DOGS; DIETARY-INTAKE; SERUM-LEVELS; ACCUMULATION	It has been described that the co-existence of parasite infection and chemical exposure has various effects on the accumulation of persistent organochlorine pollutants (POPs) in the host. Certain parasites are not only able to accumulate POPs but also seem to have the ability to metabolize certain compounds. We have designed a case-control study aimed to disclose the role of Dirofilaria immitis in the bioavailability of POPs in dogs trying to know whether these parasites store or metabolize the POPs. A total of 40 common POPs (18 polychlorinated biphenyls congeners (PCBs) and 22 organochlorine pesticides were quantified in dog serum. The study included three groups of dogs prospectively recruited in the island of Gran Canaria (Canary Islands, Spain): a) control animals, non-parasitized (serologically tested negative, n=24); b) a group constituted by dogs tested positive for heartworm disease (D. immitis) and negative for other parasites (n=25); and c) the same group of parasitized dogs after the treatment against the parasite (n=25). The presence of D. immitis was strongly associated with lower serum levels of a wide range of pollutant in their hosts (PCB congeners 28, 105, 118, 123, 138, 153, 167 and 180; hexachlorobenzene, lindane, aldrin, dieldrin, and methoxychlor). The serum levels of these substances remained at very low levels after the treatment against the parasite, suggesting that D. immitis do not simply store such compounds, but they probably have some ability to metabolize these pollutants. We encourage the use of the parasite infestation status as a cofactor that needs to be taken into account in studies aimed to evaluate the serum levels of POPs. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The main contribution of this paper is the identification of social tie patterns between market participants and their structural equivalence in the market. Furthermore, it reveals how status operates in the market, conferring advantages on those actors with optimum positioning. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Data were obtained from a personal networks' survey conducted in Catalonia (Spain), which was completed by 441 adults and gathered information about exchange of social support in networks made of 30 alters. A multilevel analysis disentangles the effects on support of these two structural dimensions at the network-level from compositional effects at the network and tie-level. The results show that network closure does not play a relevant role in support once confounders at the network and tie levels are controlled for. However, cliquishness has a significant association with labor-related support and housing support, net of statistical controls. Implications of these results in network research are discussed.

Our aim is to provide a further step into the generalization of this class of models by considering sample spaces which involve both families of networks and nodal properties verifying combinatorial constraints. We propose a class of probabilistic models for the joint distribution of nodal properties (demographic and behavioral characteristics) and network structures (friendship and professional partnership). It results in a general and flexible modeling framework to account for homophily in social structures. We present a Bayesian estimation method based on the full characterization of their sample spaces by systems of linear constraints. This provides an exact simulation scheme to sample from the likelihood, based on linear programming techniques. After a detailed analysis of the proposed statistical methodology, we illustrate our approach with an empirical analysis of co-authorship of journal articles in the field of neuroscience between 2009 and 2013.

J	Finger, K; Lux, T				Finger, Karl; Lux, Thomas			orr Network formation in the interbank money market: An application of the actor-oriented model	SOCIAL NETWORKS			English	Article						Interbank market; Network formation; Financial crisis	SYSTEMIC RISK; FRIENDSHIP; TOPOLOGY; DYNAMICS; SCHOOLS	This paper investigates the driving forces behind banks' link formation in the interbank market by applying the stochastic actor oriented model (SAOM). Our data consists of quarterly networks constructed from the transactions on an electronic trading platform (e-MID) for interbank credit over the period from 2001 to 2010. The analysis strongly supports the hypothesis that the existence and extent of past credit relationships is a major determinant of credit provision (i.e., link formation) in subsequent periods. We also find explanatory power of size-related characteristics, but little influence of past interest rates. The actor based analysis, thus, confirms the prevalent view that interbank credit is mainly determined by lasting business relationships and less so by competition for the best price (interest rate). Our findings also show that topological features exert a certain influence on the network formation process. The major changes found for the period after the onset of the financial crisis are that: (1) large banks and those identified as 'core' intermediaries became even more sought of as counterparties and (2) indirect counterparty risk appeared to be more of a concern as we find a higher tendency to avoid indirect exposure as indicated by clustering effects.

In order to measure structural mobility, the paper proposes to trace occupational and educational changes across generations using information provided by children about their fathers. The validity of the method is assessed by comparing the effects of father's socio-economic status and education on son's status and educational attainments, net of occupational upgrading and educational expansion, in five European countries: Britain, Denmark, Germany, Norway, and Spain, using data from the 2005 EU-SILC survey. The results show that the effect of father's on son's ISEI weakens greatly in all countries after considering occupational upgrading, and that much of father's influence over sons occurs by directing them towards occupations with good economic prospects. Useful extensions to the method are discussed in the conclusions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Combined effects of reduced irrigation and water quality on the soil microbial community of a citrus orchard under semi-arid conditions	SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY			English	Article						Microbial biomass; Bacterial diversity; Enzyme activities; Regulated deficit irrigation; Wastewaters; Resilience	TREATED WASTE-WATER; BACTERIAL COMMUNITY; AGRICULTURAL SOILS; ENZYME-ACTIVITIES; RECLAIMED WATER; ORGANIC-MATTER; MANDARIN TREES; SP NOV.; RESPONSES; CARBON	Sustainable agriculture in Mediterranean areas is compromised by the structural deficit of water resources. Under this situation, the impacts of alternative water managements on the microbial community, as a critical component of the soil quality, need to be properly understood. We evaluated the long-term impacts of irrigation systems differing on the quantity and quality of water, and their interactions, on the biomass (phospholipid fatty acid analysis), diversity and composition (16S rRNA gene profiling), and enzyme activities of the soil microbial community of an orchard cultivated with grapefruit trees in South-East Spain. The impact of water quantity was evaluated by irrigation with optimal amount of water or by irrigation with a reduced volume of water in the temporal frame when the crop is less sensitive, so-called regulated deficit irrigation (RDI). The impact of water quality was evaluated attending to the source of the irrigation water: water from a river channel-transfer (TW) or reclaimed water from a wastewater treatment plant (RW). Electrical conductivity was higher in soils irrigated with RW than in soils irrigated with TW. The content of total organic C in the soil was affected by water quality but not by water quantity. Soils irrigated with TW showed higher total organic C than soils irrigated with RW. As in the case of plant productivity, RDI had a negative impact on plant productivity, soil microbial biomass and enzyme activities in summer. This finding indicates a slow-down of organic matter decomposition under restricted irrigation. Bacterial biomass was more sensitive to RDI when RW was used, whereas the fungal biomass was more sensitive to RDI when TW was used. Bacterial diversity and plant productivity were more sensitive to water quantity than to water quality. The increase of the abundance of Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes in soils irrigated with RW in summer suggested a higher resilience of this treatment mediated by copiotrophic organisms. A recovery of the enzyme activity and microbial biomass of soils irrigated with RW and RDI was observed in January and June. The resilience of biogeochemical and the microbial biomass processes after RDI coursed through changes in the structure of the microbial community as revealed by the multivariate analyses of fatty acids. The utilisation of reclaimed water during RDI promoted a more-resilient community that translated into a recovery of microbial biomass and enzyme activities after the water restriction ended. These results imply potential ecological benefits of the irrigation with reclaimed water that should be considered under the water limitation predicted in climate change models in Mediterranean areas.

Amparo			Environmental assessment of 9 European public bus transportation systems	SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY			English	Article						Urban buses; Air pollution; Urban transportation	DIESEL; GAS	The transportation sector is one of the largest sources of EUs greenhouse gas emissions. In 2011, transportation represented approximately 25 percent of total EUs greenhouse gas emissions. Urban mobility accounts for 40% of all CO2 emissions of road transport and up to 70% of other pollutants from transport. As, transportation and mobility play a crucial part both in urban economics and the quality of life, it is of great significance to ensure a low carbon transportation sector, so as to deal with the threat that climate change poses to urban areas. This study examines the factors that affect the production of carbon dioxide (CO2) as well as of air pollutants, in 9 major European cities, aiming to provide a comprehensive overview of the actual knowledge on the atmospheric pollution from public transportation systems. CO2 emissions as well as air pollutants, such as CO, HC, PM, NOx are calculated for the diesel and CNG bus fleets of the European cities under study. Finally the environmental benefits, in terms of CO2 and CO, HC, PM, NOx emissions reductions, from the penetration of different biodiesel blends (from B10 to B100) to the bus fleets are estimated.

In particular, the main goal is to identify services required in such framework to define the requirements and features of a reference architecture to support the data driven methods for energy efficiency monitoring or load prediction. With this object in mind, a use case of short-term load forecasting in non-residential buildings in the University of Girona is provided, in order to practically explain the services embedded in the described general layers architecture. In the work, classic data-driven models for load forecasting in buildings are used as an example. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The formation constant of the complex has been evaluated by polarographic titrations because of the irreversibility of electrochemical processes. This relatively small value of 2.37 x 10(5) is in agreement with the experimental conditions at which Scott's method is typically carried out to detect cocaine in solid samples by reaction with Co(II) thiocyanate.

IFN induces the expression of several antiviral proteins including BST-2, which inhibits HIV by multiple mechanisms. The viral protein Vpu counteracts different effects of BST-2. We thus asked if Vpu proteins from IFN-treated patients displayed improved anti-BST-2 activities as compared to Vpu from baseline. Deep-sequencing analyses revealed that in five of seven patients treated by IFN-alpha for a concomitant HCV infection in the absence of antiretroviral drugs, the dominant Vpu sequences differed before and during treatment. In three patients, vpu alleles that emerged during treatment improved virus replication in the presence of IFN-alpha, and two of them conferred improved virus budding from cells expressing BST-2. Differences were observed for the ability to down-regulate CD4, while all Vpu variants potently down-modulated BST-2 from the cell surface. This report discloses relevant consequences of IFN-treatment on HIV properties.

A potential explanation for the strong negative attitudes toward obese individuals relates to people's emotional reactions. In this study, conducted with 373 female students, it is suggested that physical disgust, germ aversion and perceived controllability of weight play a central role in explaining the individual differences that exist in antifat attitudes. Our results showed a positive relationship between physical disgust and germ aversion. Additionally, it has been found a positive correlation between physical disgust and perceived controllability of weight. Furthermore, a positive relationship between antifat attitudes, physical disgust and germ aversion was found. Finally, perceived controllability of weight was positively related to antifat attitudes. The path analysis conducted showed the mediational effect of perceived controllability of weight in the relationship between physical disgust and antifat attitudes. Finally, it is discussed the results in the frame of antifat attitudes literature.

Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) emphasizes the role of cognitive fusion and experiential avoidance in the development of these disorders: hi this study, it was hypothesized that the ACT concepts of cognitive fusion and experiential avoidance would mediate the relationship between dysfunctional metacognitive beliefs and anxiety/stress symptoms. A longitudinal design was employed. One hundred and six nonclinical participants responded twice to an online survey with a lapse of nine months. Cognitive fusion at Time 2 mediated the effect of negative metacognitive beliefs at Time 1 on anxiety symptoms at T2, whereas both cognitive fusion and experiential avoidance mediated the effect on stress symptoms. Cognitive fusion mediated the effect of positive metacognitive beliefs only on stress symptoms. These results warrant further comparison of the MCT and ACT models.

In this paper behavior patterns of the psychologically violent intimate relationship are outlined and psychological consequences for victims are described. Both of them are useful for distinguishing a psychological IPV from a dysfunctional relationship without systematic violent behaviors. This differentiation is very relevant in order to deal with the problem in an adequate way. Some couples can misinterpret a dysfunctional relationship as intimate partner violence. Implications for forensic practice are very different in each case. Suggestions for good practice in this field are commented on.

Participants were 914 children and adolescents with a mean age of 13.01 years (51.3% males). The EFA yielded a three-factor model representing Obsessions, Compulsions, and Cleanliness dimensions. Both, total score and subscales showed an adequate internal consistency. The Spanish version also exhibited good test-retest reliability and moderate convergent and discriminant validity. The younger participants (from 8 to 10 years) obtained higher means for total score and subscales than older participants (groups 11-13 and 14-18 years). Significant differences related to gender were also observed since males obtained higher means in Compulsions subscale. Despite more research is required, this results suggested that Spanish version of the Short LOI-CV showed a good psychometric performance assessing obsessive-compulsive symptoms in community population.

We now know that in languages of alphabetic writing like ours, learning to write requires both alphabetical knowledge and the awareness of the phonological structure of speech, with the development of spoken language a necessary skill for learning written language. However, few studies have been conducted in order to understand the link between these skills and the initial learning to write. The purpose of this study was to examine whether programs that integrate the promotion of oral language along. with the development of phonological processing skills and alphabetical knowledge favour effectiveness of the written learning process. A quasi-experimental comparison group design with pre-test and post-test measures was used. The study involved 403 students from different public and private schools aged between 5 and 6. The results weigh the potential value of the program and support the development of teaching models that provide access to alphabetic knowledge from new educational perspectives that facilitate the learning of the writing system.

The sample was composed of 260 students, attending different public and semi-public schools in the Murcia Region (Spain), with ages ranging from 8 to 15 years old. Creativity was assessed with the Torrance Test of Creativity Thinking (TTCT) and the Test of Creative Imagination (PIC). Results suggest that, even though both tests are based on the psychometric approach and Guilford's theory of creativity, their scores are not significantly correlated. Results from confirmatory factor. analysis suggest two independent factors (one for each test), more related to tasks' demands and contents than with the cognitive processes traditionally considered in the definition and measurement of creativity.

In order to do this, a K-means iterative cluster analysis was performed. A five-cluster solution turned out to be the most parsimonious in the differentiation of emotional and behavioural patterns. A five-cluster solution yielded the following patterns: "No difficulties and high prosocial scores" (n = 418; 28.36%), "high difficulties and low prosocial scores" (n = 239; 16.21%), "high on hyperactivity, low on the rest of the difficulties sub scales, and high in prosocial capabilities" (n = 302; 20.49%), "high on emotional and peer problems, relatively low on conduct and hyperactivity, and high in prosocial capabilities" (n = 275; 18.66%), and finally "hyperactivity problems and average in the others difficulties subscales, and in pro social capabilities" (a = 239; 16.21%). This cluster solution was replicated attending to the same gender and age groups. Nevertheless, differences in the distribution of the cluster composition suggest that difficulties differ by gender and age. The results allow for the conclusion that men reveal a greater number of problems of an externalizing nature whereas women indicate a greater degree of internalizing difficulties and prosocial skills.

The objective of the current research is to validate SAAS-R using multidimensional Rasch analysis. Data were collected from 1398 students attending different high schools. Principal Component Analysis supported the multidimensional SAAS-R. The item difficulty and person ability were calibrated along the same latent trait scale. 10 items were removed from the scale due to misfit with the Rasch model. Differential Item Functioning revealed no significant differences across gender for the remaining 25 items. The 7-category rating scale structure did not function well, and the subscale goal valuation obtained low reliability values. The multidimensional Rasch model supported 25 item-scale SAAS-R measures from five latent factors. Therefore, the advantages of multidimensional Rasch analysis are demonstrated in this study.

A qualitative research method was used: specifically, discourse analysis based on Potter and Wetherell's proposals concerning interpretive repertoires. It was found that defensive normalisation strategies are favoured against the risk of homophobia and attacks on family diversity. There is a risk of overlooking resources and experiences that could contribute to a richer collective construction of the phenomenon, reflecting its progress in the legislative, social, and political fields.

Eight female managers of top-level sport organizations participated in semi-structured interviews. Results showed that seven of them reported being in an environment that fulfilled their BPN and experienced autonomous motivation in their job. In contrast, one participant reported working in a context that thwarted her BPN and experienced controlled motivation. We present contextual antecedents that were considered satisfying or thwarting of the BPN of those women enrolled in management positions. Insomuch as BPN satisfaction is expected to be related to autonomous motivation and well-being, the current study provides a first insight regarding how sport organizations could promote women managers' BPN satisfaction and thus increase their autonomous motivation and well-being in such positions.

The present study seeks to assess gratitude by means of a self-report Gratitude Questionnaire (GQ-6; McCullough et al., 2002) and Life Satisfaction scale (SWLS; Diener et al., 1985). Using a multiple linear regression analysis, the relationship between life satisfaction and gratitude is analyzed. The results suggest that gratitude significantly predicts life satisfaction (on psychological and physical well-being), while on the other hand, differences exist with regard to gender in the relationship between gratitude and life satisfaction. The significance and limitations of the present findings are discussed.

This research analyses the discourses of 124 interviews done with youth from Madrid that belong to violent groups. Describe the interpretation made by young people and identifies variables and psychosocial processes to generate and explore a psychosocial model that attempts to describe the constitution and evolution of this behavior. The strategy of theory generation was applied (first 71 interviews) and afterwards, the method of analytic induction (following 53 interviews) to allow the validation of the identified model. The resulting method proposes that the upsurge of violent groups depends on the prod oils socialisation focused on three factors: milieu, opportunities and basic socialising processes. The evolution and involution of violent groups would depend on the interaction between the personal and social identities of its members.

Following current research on children's preference for non dissenters when learning the names for novel objects, this study investigated children's preference for consensus opinion in two contexts: Interracial social exclusion among peers and novel object labeling. The goal was to examine the generalizability of preference for the opinion of non dissenters in a socially relevant context. This study was conducted with 90 preschool children from the Spanish ethnic majority group. The findings revealed that participants sided with the consensus significantly less often in the social exclusion context than in the novel object labeling context. Moreover, young children did not defer to the opinion of a numerical consensus in the socially meaningful context when a group condoned the exclusion of a peer from a group activity, even when the peer was from an outgroup social category. Instead, participants agreed with a dissenter who claimed that it was not okay to exclude someone, despite the opposite opinion of a numerical majority. These results provide new information regarding children's social knowledge development.

It is interesting to incorporate this methodological development to organizational field. The objective of this research is to develop a CAT for evaluating the organizational climate. In order to do this, a bank of 160 items was constructed, which was administered to a sample of 3,163 workers (M age=51.90 years; SD=6.28 years). The results show that the CAT works efficiently for the three item banks used (150, 130 and 50 items). The information function shows that the latent trait in the whole range of values is measured with similar accuracy. The correlation between the scores obtained with the CAT, the three item banks and the CLIOR scale of organizational climate was higher than .90 in all cases (SE<0.32). With a SE<0.32, the 150 item CAT uses a mean of 22.5 items (SD = 13.5 items). The CAT developed allows an accuracy and useful assessment of the organizational climate on organizational settings and research.

The theoretical model was tested using structural equations in a sample of 277 employees of a public Administration. The good fit of the data according to the revised goodness of fit indexes, both in the confirmatory analysis for each variable and in the structural model statistically validates our theoretical model, accepting the study hypotheses. This makes clear the need for the Administration to propose transformational leadership measures at the individual, team and organizational levels to strengthen the achievement of positive outcomes through positives organizational climate and psychological capital.

Cultural differences and language use between Spain and other Spanish-speaking countries advise caution in the use of the same measurement instruments. Furthermore the instruments validated in Spain have been developed with very specific or small samples. The aim of this instrumental study was to develop a new general purpose Social Support Questionnaire that overcomes these limitations. Method. With a sample of 1080 participants (48.2% women, mean age 33.51), an exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis was conducted, examining its internal consistency, reliability, convergent validity, content validity and readability. Results: A three-factor structure (Friends, Family and Significant Others Support) was replicated and confirmed (with a very good fit), explaining nearly 73% of the variance with an excellent internal consistency (.94 or more) with significant evidence of convergent validity with other related measurements of Social Support and Health. Conclusions: The parameters of structural validity, internal consistency, reliability and convergent validity, taken together, present an optimized profile when compared to the rest of the reviewed surveys.

Among the main findings, we can point out that positive emotional states increase significantly when cooperative games are applied, with competition. Negative moods are more present in individual games, with no competition, when practiced by men and when they are organized in separate groups. All these factors contribute towards knowing the influence of play on the training of the future teachers of a modem physical education, in which there is the intention of promoting such important aspects as socioemotional well-being and co-education.

MD has yet to be studied in weightlifters, and the objective of this research study is to detect its symptoms in 32 male weightlifters as well as any related characteristics and behaviours. This study involved the distribution of a sociodemographic questionnaire in addition to the Escala de Satisfaction Muscular, the Physical Self-Concept Questionnaire, and the Somatomorphic Matrix, with the anthropometric measurements of the participants also being recorded. The results revealed the existence of body dissatisfaction among athletes and, in some cases, muscle perception that does not equate to reality. The athletes also use substances to build their muscles and enhance their performance, display obsessive muscle checking behaviours, and have low general physical self-concept that stems from their muscle (dis)satisfaction. To conclude, this study confirms the existence of MD in this sport.

An entropy-based analysis of the relationship between the DOW JONES Index and the TRNA Sentiment series	APPLIED ECONOMICS			English	Article						DJIA; sentiment; entropy; TRNA; information	INVESTOR SENTIMENT; STOCK-MARKET; INFORMATION; RETURNS	This article features an analysis of the relationship between the DOW JONES Industrial Average (DJIA) Index and a sentiment news series using daily data obtained from the Thomson Reuters News Analytics (TRNA) provided by SIRCA (The Securities Industry Research Centre of the Asia Pacific). The recent growth in the availability of on-line financial news sources, such as internet news and social media sources provides instantaneous access to financial news. Various commercial agencies have started developing their own filtered financial news feeds which are used by investors and traders to support their algorithmic trading strategies. TRNA is one such data set. In this study, we use the TRNA data set to construct a series of daily sentiment scores for DJIA stock index component companies. We use these daily DJIA market sentiment scores to study the relationship between financial news sentiment scores and the stock prices of these companies using entropy measures. The entropy and mutual information (MI) statistics permit an analysis of the amount of information within the sentiment series, its relationship to the DJIA and an indication of how the relationship changes over time.

Artificial seagrass leaves shield transplanted seagrass seedlings and increase their survivorship	AQUATIC BOTANY			English	Article						Marine plants; Facilitation; Restoration; Recovery; Herbivory; Artificial leaves; Atlantic Ocean	CYMODOCEA-NODOSA; CANARY-ISLANDS; SPATIAL VARIABILITY; MEADOWS; RESTORATION; GERMINATION; PRESSURE; GROWTH	Seagrass meadows provide important ecosystem functions and services. The progressive global deterioration of seagrass meadows requires management strategies to stop and recover seagrass losses. Seagrass restoration can be promoted using seagrass seedlings germinated in vitro, but early mortality of seedlings is a severe bottleneck for successful restoration programs. In this study, we tested a technique to promote in situ survivorship of in vitro germinated seedlings of the seagrass Cymodocea nodosa. In particular, we predicted that artificial seagrass leaves (plastic green raffia, i.e. 'Artificial Seagrass Shields', ASSs) surrounding seagrass seedlings would increase the long-term survivorship of seedlings by decreasing herbivory-induced mortality. After 2 years, the survivorship of seagrass seedlings in plots without the ASSs was nil, whereas one third of plots containing ASSs developed small-sized seagrass patches, including a one order of magnitude exponential increase in shoot density. Herbivory intensity on seagrass leaves significantly decreased when surrounded with ASSs. This study demonstrates how ASSs facilitate the establishment of transplanted seagrass seedlings and suggests ASSs could be a cheap, easy-to-use, restoration element to promote the survivorship of seagrass seedlings by decreasing the magnitude of herbivory.

Time and heat for sexual reproduction: comparing the phenology of Chara hispida of two populations at different latitudes	AQUATIC BOTANY			English	Article						Charophytes; Temperature; Growing Degree Days; Geographical factors; Hopkins' Bioclimatic Law	CLIMATE-CHANGE; VULGARIS L; SUBMERGED MACROPHYTES; ECOLOGICAL RESPONSES; CHAROPHYTES CHARALES; TEMPORARY WETLANDS; WATER; EVOLUTION; ACCUMULATION; TEMPERATURE	Geographical location affects the main ecological factors driving the timing of plants' life events. In addition, studying phenology is the simplest procedure to track current global warming and its effects on the success and survival of different populations of the same species. Little is known about the effect of water temperature and its corresponding accumulated heat on charophytes' phenology. We compared differences in water temperature and sexual reproductive phenology of Chara hispida in two ponds of two countries located at different latitudes (Spain and Switzerland) over the same year. We estimated the accumulated heat required to develop from one phenophase to another (unripe/ripe gametangia and oospores). Curve fitting techniques on water temperature showed an advance of 26 days in the Spanish spring onset. All phenological events happened for the first time around 40 days earlier in the Spanish pond, agreeing with the Hopkins' Bioclimatic Law prediction. C. hispida sexually reproduced in a daily mean temperature (DMT) range of 10-25 degrees C and needed 600 growing degree-days (GDD) to ripen gametangia in the Spanish pond. The Swiss population required a higher DMT (15 degrees C) to begin to reproduce, and similar to 700 GDD to initiate gametangia ripening. Temperature (as well as radiation) is one of the most important drivers of reproductive phenology, and accumulated heat is a better predictor than DMT for charophyte phenology. In the foreseeable warming scenario, we assume that C. hispida sexual events would advance by more than one month in Switzerland and expand at the end of the season, considerably lengthening its reproductive period.

On the one hand, survival depended on assemblers' strategies to promote economies of scale and scope, process and product innovation, related diversification, internationalisation and, sometimes, changes of ownership. On the other, firms benefitted from long-term path-dependent growth in their countries of origin's industrial systems. Indeed, the main winners of the period, Toyota and Volkswagen, can rightly be seen as outstanding examples of Confucian and Rhine capitalism. However, since then, global convergence with Anglo-Saxon capitalism may have eroded some of the institutional bases of their strength.

In late 1972, the Spanish government enacted the so-called Ford decrees. The intention was to stimulate specialisation in the European arena by inserting the Spanish subsidiaries within the international strategies of large transnational corporations. In doing so, the effects of the economic crisis were compounded by the restructuring of the sector. The goal is to understand how, in the midst of this situation, FASA-Renault was able to increase production and the size of its workforce, ultimately becoming the leading firm in the sector in terms of production and sales in Spain. This is remarkable, due to the fact that labour force participation in Spain fell by nearly 3 million people from 1974 to 1985. The article argues that FASA-Renault, albeit with nuances, kept its commitment to diversification, neither adopting practices inspired by the production systems of the large Japanese manufacturers nor following the model put forward by the US giants based on large-scale production of a single low- to mid-range car for export.

Reducing deficiencies in physical properties, organic matter, and nutrients with a contribution of treated sewage sludge is proposed. This experiment was based on a controlled study using columns. The work was done with two limestone quarry spoils, both very rich in calcite. Two biosolid doses were undertaken (30,000 and 90,000 kg/ha of sewage sludge) in addition to different quarry spoils used as substrates. The water contribution was provided by a device simulating short duration rain. The leached water was collected 24 h after the last application. Nitrate, ammonium, phosphate, sulfate, and chloride ions were determined, as well as Ca, Mg, Na and K, the pH and electrical conductivity. The electrical conductivity limit value is <1000 mu S/cm. These values will be met from the fourth irrigation application onward, while the values up to that point were far superior. Significant nitrate concentrations appeared that may pose an environmental contamination risk. A comparison between the concentrations of the chemical elements obtained in the leachates from our experiment and the established limit values for water of the third quality group has been performed. The electrical conductivity correlated well with the cations, with the exception of potassium. For sulfates, significant correlations were obtained with the Mg2+, Ca2+, and K+ cations. The chlorides showed excellent correlation with the sodium. The good correlations obtained for some physical-chemical parameters can help to establish indicators of environmental quality of leachates over time. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Biocrusts are an essential surface component of these ecosystems and one of the most important contributors to surface resistance and stability, and therefore, keeping soil fertile in these nutrient-limited-environments. Loss of biocrusts can result in increased sediment losses and subsequent loss of soil organic carbon (SOC) and other soil resources, which are vital for vegetation and general ecosystem functioning. Despite their importance, the consequences of biocrust loss on sediment and SOC losses in drylands have been poorly analysed. In this study, we examined the influence of two biocrust types (cyanobacteria and lichen-dominated biocrusts) and biocrust removal on runoff and sediment yield, from natural rainfall during one hydrological year in a semiarid badlands catchment (Tabernas, SE Spain). The influence of biocrust type and biocrust removal on SOC losses from water erosion (dissolved and sediment organic carbon losses, DOC and SdOC, respectively) was also analysed. Our results show that sediment yield significantly increased after biocrust removal, especially during the first rain after biocrust removal, when particles were left directly exposed to raindrop impact and easily washed away by runoff. Annual sediment yield was 465, 75 and 24 g In-2 in biocrust-removed, cyanobacteria-covered and lichen-covered soil, respectively, and the first event represented 87% of annual sediment losses on biocrust-removed plots. Biocrust removal was accompanied by a significant increase in both DOC and SdOC mobilisation. Total organic carbon (TOC) mobilisation was the highest in soils where the biocrust had been removed and decreased as the biocrust was more developed. Annual TOC mobilisation was 10.2, 3.0 and 1.4 g m(-2) in biocrust-removed, cyanobacteria-covered and lichen-covered soil, respectively. TOC mobilisation was mainly driven by sediments and thus, 89% of annual TOC mobilisation occurred during the first rain after biocrust removal. The high sediment and SOC losses recorded after biocrust removal emphasize the importance of biocrust conservation for avoiding the loss of soil resources and maintaining fertility in interplant soils in drylands.

In particular, thin curved fuselage panels are widely employed. However, the theoretical difficulties in the underlying differential problem induced by the curvature, as well as a still under development technology of CNT-based composites, the number of studies dealing with buckling behavior of this structural typology is limited. The present study aims to provide some insight into the linear buckling analysis of functionally graded carbon-nanotube reinforced (FG-CNTRC) cylindrical curved panels under compressive and shear loading. Effective properties of materials of the panels reinforced by single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are estimated through a micromechanical model based on either the Eshelby-Mori-Tanaka approach or the extended rule of mixtures. A series of numerical simulations have been carried out to inspect the influence of curvature, panel aspect ratio, the distribution profile of reinforcements (uniform and three non-uniform distributions) and CNTs orientation angle on the buckling critical load under compressive and shear loading in uniform thermal environments. Results demonstrate that the change of fiber orientation, CNTs distribution, panel aspect ratio, loading condition and temperature have noticeable effects on the buckling strength and buckling modes of FG-CNTRC curved panels.

Joints of NORCOAT LIEGE cork with C/C SiC ceramic matrix composite were fabricated using a) high temperature commercial inorganic adhesives and b) in-situ polymerization of the cork on top of the CMC. Mechanical shear tests under ambient conditions and in liquid nitrogen are carried out. The ultimate shear strength of all the adhesive joints at room temperature varies between 0.52 and 0.78 MPa and is similar to that of the in-situ joints. At liquid nitrogen temperature the shear strength is enhanced by up to 80%, but the ultimate shear strain decreases up to 55%. The failure mode is discussed for the two types of the fabrication procedure. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Three anchor lengths have been used. The test pieces have been submitted to pull-compression test until failure after three different previous conditionings: preservation in a normalized atmosphere, artificial accelerated weathering cycles, and climate conditioning under uniform service load. The results indicate that the aging cycles lead to drops of stiffness and pull-out strength in the joints with usual anchorage lengths in practice. Therefore, there is not a significant difference in the value of those losses due to the action of the service load during the accelerated weathering cycles. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

A key issue for the design and optimization of these composites is the development of theoretical models capable of providing a quantitative prediction of their overall electrical conductivity. Experimental results have evidenced the strong influence of the waviness and dispersion of the nano tubes on the overall conductivity of these materials, what makes the consideration of these two phenomena essential for the development of realistic theoretical models. Nevertheless, both waviness and agglomeration have been often neglected in the literature or, when considered, have been reproduced with very simple modeling approaches not suitable to catch the complexity of the problem at hand. This paper presents an improved micromechanics model of the effective electrical conductivity of CNT cement-based nanocomposites based on enhanced approaches for reproducing waviness and non-uniform spatial distributions of the nanoinclusions. The two mechanisms that govern the electrical conductivity of these composites, electron hopping and conductive networks, are incorporated in the mixed micromechanics model. On the basis of scanning electron microscopy inspections, a helical waviness model and a two-parameter agglomeration approach are proposed. In order to assess the accuracy of the proposed analytical model, cement-based specimens have been manufactured and tested for providing data to use as the basis of comparison. In particular, specimens of cement pastes, mortars and concretes with different concentrations of Multi-Walled Carbon Nanotubes (MWCNTs) have been prepared. It is shown that the consideration of straight uniformly distributed nanotubes, as typically done in the literature, leads to an overestimation of the overall conductivity. On the contrary, it is highlighted that the wavy state of the fibers as well as their agglomeration in bundles play a crucial role in the conductivity of cement-based nanocomposites, which is demonstrated by achieving a good fit to the experimental data when using the proposed models for waviness and agglomeration. Overall, the paper highlights the physical mechanisms governing the overall electrical conductivity of cement-based composites with MWCNTs and provides a powerful analytical tool for their design.

For these models the Fisher information matrix (FIM) is proportional to the FIM of a weighted simple linear regression model. The same is also true when the weight function has a finite integral. Thus, optimal designs for one binary model are also optimal for the corresponding weighted linear regression model. The main objective of this paper is to provide a tool for the construction of MV-optimal designs, minimizing the maximum of the variances of the estimates, for a general design space. Methods: MV-optimality is a potentially difficult criterion because of its nondifferentiability at equal variance designs. A methodology for obtaining MV-optimal designs where the design space is a compact interval [a, b] will be given for several standard weight functions. Results: The methodology will allow us to build a user-friendly computer tool based on Mathematica to compute MV-optimal designs. Some illustrative examples will show a representation of MV-optimal designs in the Euclidean plane, taking a and b as the axes. The applet will be explained using two relevant models. In the first one the case of a weighted linear regression model is considered, where the weight function is directly chosen from a typical family. In the second example a binary response model is assumed, where the probability of the outcome is given by a typical probability distribution. Conclusions: Practitioners can use the provided applet to identify the solution and to know the exact support points and design weights. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this work, we propose a novel in silico model of mesenchymal 3D migration with competing protrusions under a chemotactic gradient. Based on recent experimental observations, we identify three main stages that can regulate mesenchymal chemotaxis: chemosensing, dendritic protrusion dynamics and cell-matrix interactions. Therefore, each of these features is considered as a different module of the main regulatory computational algorithm. The numerical model was particularized for the case of fibroblast chemotaxis under a PDGF-bb gradient. Fibroblasts migration was simulated embedded in two different 3D matrices - collagen and fibrin - and under several PDGF-bb concentrations. Validation of the model results was provided through qualitative and quantitative comparison with in vitro studies. Our numerical predictions of cell trajectories and speeds were within the measured in vitro ranges in both collagen and fibrin matrices. Although in fibrin, the migration speed of fibroblasts is very low, because fibrin is a stiffer and more entangling matrix. Testing PDGF-bb concentrations, we noticed that an increment of this factor produces a speed increment. At 1ngmL(-1) a speed peak is reached after which the migration speed diminishes again.

The latter are grouped into three different classes according to their geometry and electronic distribution: pyramidal, symmetric planar trigonal and asymmetric planar trigonal. Different reactivity patterns can be then outlined for each of these classes of metal complexes, which differ in many ways from those characterizing the extensively studied chemical behaviour of mononuclear phosphinidene complexes.

This is the only example of a Cretaceous lacertiform or lizard-like trackway currently known in the global track record. Although lacertiform trackways, mostly assigned to the ichnogenus Rhynchosauroides, are common in the global Triassic, they are almost entirely absent in the Jurassic and Cretaceous. Moreover, ichnological classification criteria allow that Neosauroides is morphologically distinct from Rhynchosauroides at the genus level, and more like the tracks of the extant lizard Sceloporus. The reasons for the conspicuous lack of post-Triassic occurrences are not certain, but not due to a post-Triassic lack of potential lizard track makers. Thus, the preservation biases are likely due to paleobiological factors such as trackmaker ecology and paleoenvironmental preference. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, organic molecules bound within diatom frustules represent another phase for measurement of delta C-13 and offer the opportunity to obtain epsilon(p) for specific diatom sizes and geometries. Here, from core top sediments covering a strong productivity gradient in the Southern Ocean, we present determinations of delta C-13 and ep from frustule-bound organic matter from a fine opal fraction dominated by pennate diatoms and a coarse opal fraction dominated by larger centric diatoms. The delta C-13 of the pennate diatom fraction is typically 2.8 parts per thousand more positive than that of the centric fraction. Both fractions show a comparable range of 9-10 parts per thousand over the core top transect. epsilon(p) is lowest (6.3 parts per thousand in pennate fraction) between the Polar Front (PF) and Southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front (SACCF) and increases both to the north and south, with maximum values at greatest distance from the PF (18 parts per thousand in the pennate fraction). These spatial changes in epsilon(p) are too large to arise from the rather modest variation in dissolved CO2 in surface waters across the core top transect. We suggest instead that the maximum epsilon(p) reflects higher diatom growth rates, and in the case of pennate diatom F. kerguelensis also an increase in the frustule width and volume to surface area ratio. Both processes may result from enhanced Fe supply due to upwelling of circumpolar deep water between the PF and SACCF. Farther south, diatom growth is strongly Fe-limited and farther north it is Fe and Si co-limited. The optima of growth rates between the PF and SACCF appears to be a general feature in all sectors of the Southern Ocean. Such growth rate-induced changes in diatom epsilon(p) allow us to resolve a 5 degrees northward displacement of the PF during glacial times compared to interglacial times. By estimating CO2 (aq) in equilibrium with the Holocene ice core atmospheric CO2 concentrations, we quantify this growth rate effect and document that it is strongly correlated with indicators of trace metal supply, such as frustule Zn content, as well as indicators of diatom productivity such as opal % and opal accumulation rates in sediments and sediment traps. These relationships may be applied to constrain the effect of growth rate variations on ep and more accurately derive CO2 variations from ep during periods prior to ice core CO2 proxy records.

Using enviromagnetic and geochemical data, we provide a continuous and well-dated record of the evolution of glacial/interglacial sedimentation on the Northwest Iberian Margin during the last glacial period, covering the last six Heinrich Stadials. The record shows European sediments that were related to meltwater pre-events during the initial stages of HS1, HS2, and HS4 that corroborate the Channel River depositional history. The record also includes IRD from the Laurentide Ice Sheet and the European Ice Sheet during the final stages of these stadials, i.e., Heinrich Events. Therefore, this study provides insight into one of the potential forcing mechanisms for Heinrich Events and, by inference, for Heinrich Stadials. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Among them, beta-cyclocitral (beta-CC), at least, is a retrograde signaling molecule that modulates the activity of many key physiological processes. In the present work, we aimed to study whether beta-CC and other VCCPs are released into the atmosphere from photosynthetic tissues. To overcome stomatal limitations, the foliose chlorolichen Lobaria pulmonaria was used as the model system, and the emissions of biogenic volatiles, induced by heat and wounding stresses, were monitored by proton-transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometry (PTR-TOF-MS) and gas-chromatography (GC-MS). Prior to stress treatments, VCCPs were emitted constitutively, accounting for 1.3% of the total volatile release, with beta-CC being the most abundant VCCP. Heat and wounding stresses induced a burst of volatile release, including VCCPs, and a loss of carotenoids. Under heat stress, the production of beta-CC correlated positively with temperature. However the enhancement of production of VCCPs was the lowest among all the groups of volatiles analyzed. Given that the rates of carotenoid loss were three orders of magnitude higher than the release rates of VCCPs and that these compounds only represent a minor fraction in the blend of volatiles, it seems unlikely that VCCPs might represent a global stress signal capable of diffusing through the atmosphere to different neighboring individuals.

Mercury tolerance study in holm oak populations from the Almaden mining district (Spain)	ENVIRONMENTAL AND EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY			English	Article						Mercury; Holm oak; Almaden; Heritable trait; Upper tolerance	SEED-GERMINATION; MEDICAGO-SATIVA; ACCUMULATION; PLANTS; RESPONSES; TOXICITY; CADMIUM; METALS; DAMAGE; WIND	The Almaden area (Central Spain) has been the mining district with the largest mercury exploitation of the world since Roman times. In this place, the natural vegetation could have undergone heritable adaptations to mercury caused by the long exposure times to this toxic element. The aim of this work is to study if the main arboreal species of the district (Quercus ilex) has been able to develop a heritable tolerance to mercury. For this purpose, six holm oak populations (three from the Almaden mining district and three from an uncontaminated area) were selected. From these populations, hundreds of acorns were collected and then were sown and grown subjected to three mercury solutions (5, 25 and 50 mu M Hg). The response to the treatments was evaluated in relation to germination rates, biomass, Hg accumulation and nutrient uptake. On the whole all populations behaved in the same way when subjected to the different treatments. Just one population showed a worse development, probably as a consequence of the negative quality site where the acorns were collected. None of the mercury treatments injured seriously to none of the seedlings, thus Q. ilex seems to be a species more tolerant to mercury than other woody species that have been studied previously (Moreno Jimenezet al., 2007, 2009).

In, the present study, three methodologies were developed for the identification of aquaculture and fisheries Egyptian fish: forensically informative nucleotide sequencing (FINS), single nucleotide polymorphism based polymerase chain reaction-terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (SNP-based PCR-T-RFLP) capillary electrophoresis, and SNP-based PCR-RFLP. FINS based on mitochondrial 12S rDNA allowed the genetic identification of seventeen Egyptian species analyzed. Four SNPs, located in restriction sites, also enable identifying all species. The resolution power of agarose gel electrophoresis was not enough to detect small-sized fragments, whereas T-RFLP capillary electrophoresis produced complete species specific patterns.

Effect of charcoal blending with a vitrinite rich coking coal on coke reactivity	FUEL PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Coal Science and Technology (ICC and T) / Australia-China Symposium on Energy (ACSE)	SEP 27-OCT 01, 2015	Melbourne, AUSTRALIA			Charcoal; Coke; Coke reactivity; Thermogravimetry - TGA	WOODY BIOMASS; THERMOPLASTIC PROPERTIES; METALLURGICAL COKES; BLAST-FURNACE; CO2; BEHAVIOR; STEEL	The aim of this work was to investigate the effect that adding charcoal to a coking coal has upon the CO2 reactivity and structure of cokes produced at a laboratory scale. Charcoal was added to a vitrinite-rich medium volatile coking coal in three amounts (3, 5 and 8 wt%) and in two different particle size ranges (below 1 mm and between 3 and 4 mm) and carbonization was conducted in a laboratorial scale coke oven. Thermogravimetric analyses were used to assess coke reactivity towards CO2 under isothermal and nonisothermal conditions. Morphological analyses via optical and scanning electron microscopies using samples from before and after gasification were also carried out. It was found that controlling the amount and the particle size of charcoal added, coke reactivity did not differ considerably from the reference coke, although the TGA indicated that the addition of charcoal has the tendency to increase coke reactivity. The main structural changes due charcoal addition were the increase of coke surface area and the decrease of its structural order, justifying the noticed increase of coke reactivity.

Pulverized combustion under conventional (O-2/N-2) and oxy-fuel (O-2/CO2) conditions of biomasses treated at different temperatures	FUEL PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Coal Science and Technology (ICC and T) / Australia-China Symposium on Energy (ACSE)	SEP 27-OCT 01, 2015	Melbourne, AUSTRALIA				DROP TUBE FURNACE; BLAST-FURNACE; COAL COMBUSTION; CHARS; INJECTION; TORREFACTION; ATMOSPHERES; CARBONIZATION; REACTIVITY; PCI	Incorporation of biomass as a partial substitute of coal in industrial processes is one of the most important ways to reduce CO2 emissions to the atmosphere. The combination of its combustion with CO2 capture technologies, such as oxy-fuel, may lead to negative emissions, decreasing CO2 emissions of power and ironmaking plants. Densification of biomass by torrefaction and carbonization is necessary to improve its energetic characteristics and allows its incorporation in large-scale facilities. In this study, chips of three woody biomasses and an olive stone previously torrefied at 250 degrees C and carbonized at 450 degrees C were pulverized and combusted in a Drop Tube Furnace (DTF) at 1300 degrees C using different O-2/N-2 and O-2/CO2 atmospheres with variable O-2 concentrations. The characteristics of the chars were evaluated by its reactivity in air and CO2 in thermobalance, optical microscopy and adsorption isotherms techniques. The biomasses that were treated at lower temperatures yielded higher burnouts and compared to conventional combustion (O-2/N-2), the conversion results were slightly higher under oxy-fuel (O-2/CO2) conditions for all biomasses. Torrefied biomass chars showed isotropic cenospheric particles with high porosity within the walls and chars from carbonized biomasses showed an isotropic fusinoid structure whereas olive stone showed massive particles. The pre-treatment temperature had showed relatively low impact in the distribution of porosity of the chars generated from them and surface areas of O-2/CO2 chars were higher than those of O-2/N-2 ones. Apparent reactivities were in general higher for the chars generated from the torrefied biomasses and were generally close for chars from both conventional and oxy-fuel atmospheres.

On the reduction behavior, structural and mechanical features of iron ore-carbon briquettes	FUEL PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Coal Science and Technology (ICC and T) / Australia-China Symposium on Energy (ACSE)	SEP 27-OCT 01, 2015	Melbourne, AUSTRALIA			Cold briquetting; Ferro-carbon; Self-reducing briquettes; Carbonization; Blast furnace	COKE; COAL; BIOMASS; STRENGTH; BLENDS	The utilization of Ferro-coke briquettes is increasingly being considered as a process to reduce CO2 emissions and energy consumption in blast furnace. The briquettes were prepared using iron ore, charcoal, lime, a binder and three different coals of poor coking properties. The coals have Gieseler maximum fluidity below 100 ddpm and are vitrinite-rich with inertinite content close to 30%. The briquettes were carbonized up to 1000 degrees C in a laboratory -scale oven and in a thermogravimetric analyzer which permitted a detailed evaluation of the weight loss at each stage of carbonization. Iron reduction, strength (both compression and drum tests) and optical properties of the carbon matrix were evaluated in the carbonized briquettes. The carbonization process caused significant differences in the optical textures of the carbonized materials, in particular in higher rank coals, where there was a greater range of optical texture sizes compared to the cokes from single coals. The best resistance to compression was observed in the briquettes with the larger optical texture, whereas the best resistance in a drum was that of the briquettes having larger proportion of mosaics. Furthermore, the Fe-coke briquettes produced by cold briquetting and carbonization show self-reducing properties of iron oxides. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Flores, B.

Regional positioning services as economic and construction activity indicators: the case study of Andalusian Positioning Network (Southern Spain)	Geocarto International			English	Article						GPS; network RTK; active permanent network; Spanish construction crisis; permit building	CRISIS	The Andalusian Positioning Network (RAP) is a regional GNSS permanent network in Southern Spain that offers two public services for precise positioning: real-time (RAP-Internet Protocol [IP]) and post processing (RAP-File Transfer Protocol [FTP]). Most of the registered users are linked to the construction sector, so the collapse of the housing bubble and the Spanish economic crisis influenced the use of RAP services from 2008. The behaviour of these services has differed somewhat, although analysis for the years 2008-2013 reveals a general decline. Since 2009, the RAP-FTP service demand fell by 50%, but the RAP-IP service was stable until October 2011, when it began a steep decline in December 2012. Analysing the temporal demand and the geospatial connections of RAP-IP with economic impact indicators, we found a high linear correlation between this service and jobs in the construction sector (.98) and permit building (.96). The real-time and associated geoinformation are its main advantages.

MethodsPatients fully suppressed on first-line antiretrovirals (viral load < 50 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL) were switched to DRV/r 800/100 mg once daily, either as monotherapy (n = 137) or with two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) (n = 136). Treatment failure was HIV-1 RNA level 50 copies/mL at week 96 or discontinuation of study treatment [Food and Drug Administration (FDA) snapshot algorithm]. ResultsPatients were mainly male and white, with mean age 44 years. In the primary efficacy analysis, the percentage of patients with HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL by week 96 [intent to treat (ITT)] was lower in the DRV/r monotherapy arm (103 of 137 patients; 75%) than in the triple therapy arm (116 of 136 patients; 85%) [difference -10.1%; 95% confidence interval (CI) -19.5, -0.7%]. In the switch-included analysis, monotherapy was noninferior to triple therapy. In a post hoc analysis, for patients with nadir CD4 count 200 cells/L, rates of HIV-1 RNA suppression were 82 of 96 patients (85%) in the DRV/r monotherapy arm and 88 of 106 patients (83%) in the triple therapy arm. No treatment-emergent primary protease inhibitor mutations were detected in either arm. The frequency of adverse events was similar in the two arms; however, one patient in the monotherapy arm was hospitalized with HIV encephalitis and elevated cerebrospinal fluid HIV-1 RNA. ConclusionsIn this study, in patients with HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at baseline, switching to DRV/r monotherapy showed lower efficacy vs. triple therapy at week 96 in the primary ITT switch-equals-failure analysis, particularly in patients with CD4 counts < 200 cells/L.

MethodsAll patients in the Collaboration of Observational HIV Epidemiological Research Europe (COHERE) cohort who were aged 18 years and started cART for the first time between 1 January 2005 and 1 January 2010 and who had at least one available measurement of CD4 count and a viral load 50 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL at 6 months ( 3 months) after cART initiation were included in the study. Unadjusted and adjusted references curves and predictions were obtained using quantile regressions. ResultsA total of 28 992 patients were included in the study. The median CD4 T-cell count at treatment initiation was 249 [interquartile range (IQR) 150, 336] cells/L. The median observed CD4 counts at 6, 9 and 12 months were 382 (IQR 256, 515), 402 (IQR 274, 543) and 420 (IQR 293, 565) cells/L. The two main factors explaining the variation of CD4 count at 6 months were AIDS stage and CD4 count at cART initiation. A CD4 count increase of 100 cells/mL is generally required in order that patients stay on track' (i.e. with a CD4 count at the same percentile as when they started), with slightly higher gains required for those starting with CD4 counts in the higher percentiles. Individual predictions adjusted for factors influencing CD4 count were more precise. ConclusionsReference curves aid the evaluation of the immune response early after antiretroviral therapy initiation that leads to viral control.

This article analyses the maps in the possession of Manuel Agote, a Spanish factor in Canton at the end of the eighteenth century. The focus is on the use made by Agote of a Chinese map of Hainan, together with the European maps available already in China for commercial interests, and the way this reflects the cultural dialogue that was operating among local and foreign cartographers engaged in similar European mapping activities in the region.

Presintering of TiCN-TiC-WC-Cr3C2-Ni cermets under N-2-H-2 atmospheres	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REFRACTORY METALS & HARD MATERIALS			English	Article							POWDER MIXTURES; HARD ALLOYS; MICROSTRUCTURE	C/N ratios in TiCN-TiC-WC-Cr3C2-Ni cermets can be intentionally modified by changing the composition of the presintering atmosphere. This affects not only the sinterability but also the final microstructure of these materials. Melting occurs at lower temperatures as the nitrogen content of the presintering atmosphere rises. However, the final densities are lower due to the precipitation of free carbon. Grain growth of the carbonitride phase is accelerated in samples presintered in N-2 due to the activation of solution reprecipitation kinetics. Finally, the precipitation of the Cr-rich M7C3 carbide can also be controlled by the appropriate selection of the presintering atmosphere up to 7.8 wt.% Cr contents. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Processing and analysis of FeNbC cermets	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REFRACTORY METALS & HARD MATERIALS			English	Article						Cermets Fe-NbC; NbC in situ; Thermal analysis; Processing; Field Assisted Hot Pressing; NbC particle size	HIGH-SPEED STEEL; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; POWDER; MATRIX; COMPOSITE; CO; MICROSTRUCTURE; METALLURGY; RESISTANCE; HARDMETALS	Cermets, especially hard metals are materials of wide application in tools due to its excellent properties like hardness and toughness. The aim of this work is to analyze cermets composed mainly of Fe, NbC, and different Al contents, materials under development supplied by CBMM (Companhia Brasileira de Metalurgia e Mineractio), in its characteristics and processing. The synthesis for obtaining of starting materials adds elements such as Fe, Al, Si, and Ti to the Nb ores to produces niobium carbides in situ, which is believed to result in a greater bond between the carbide and metal matrix. These raw materials were fully characterized. Thermal analysis was made to the planning of the process, and consolidations were made by conventional powder metallurgy, (Pressing and Sintering - PS), and by Field Assisted Hot Pressing (FAHP). The results showed that these materials are promising for application in tools that require high hardness, as in forming tools, which generally are produced with hard metals. The cermet FeNbC5Al processed showed high densification and hardness of approximately 830 HV10. However, these cermets could have even better properties with the elimination of the present intermetallic phase in the matrix, increasing the carbide content and decreasing its particle size.

Drivers and barriers to the adoption and diffusion of Sustainable Jet Fuel (SJF) in the US Pacific Northwest	JOURNAL OF AIR TRANSPORT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Sustainable jet fuel (SJF); Drivers and barriers; Aviation fuel logistics; ASTM approved SJF production pathways; SJF blending; Tracking and crediting; US Pacific Northwest (PNW) region	BIOFUEL; AVIATION	Sustainable Jet Fuel (SJF) represents an important component of the airline industry's strategy to simultaneously reduce GHG emissions while meeting a growing demand for international air travel. SJFs also have the potential to provide fuel supply diversification and security, enhance fuel price stability and provide regional/rural economic development benefits. This paper measures and ranks perceived drivers and barriers to an economically viable SJF industry in a unique U.S. region, the U.S. Pacific Northwest (PNW), through personal interviews with key aviation fuel supply chain stakeholders conducted from June to September 2015. In addition to providing a fertile arena for this first effort to systematically assess these drivers and barriers, the U.S. PNW is unique due to the region's long strategic focus on aviation innovation and its importance to the regional economy, the seminal efforts in the region to outline a path forward on SJF beginning in 2010, and the relatively small population spread over a large geographic area with a limited number of "hub" airport nodes which geographically concentrates aviation fuel demand and distribution. Nineteen stakeholder interviewees acknowledge that, in order for regional SJF adoption-diffusion to occur, airline jet fuel buyers must drive the process, particularly as they deal with greenhouse gas (GHG) emission issues and related policy considerations. Important perceived barriers to SJF industry scale-up in the U.S. PNW include the high production costs of SJF and related issues, such as fuel logistics and quality control in the transport, storage, and blending of SJFs. Perceptions around chain of-custody issues, such as blending, tracking, and crediting of SJFs and future SJF market share projections for the year 2030 were also examined. Incorporating stakeholder input into discussions about adding blended SJF into the U.S. aviation fuel supply provides needed insight for the biofuels industry, policymakers, and researchers.

This paper presents how CDM operates in the Turnaround Process (TAP) to propose a new method for managing the collaborative turnaround performance of all actors by predicting the most critical indicators. To achieve this, data from a CDM airport is used. Sample data of 6500 observations, taken from turnaround movements handled in 2014 at Madrid-Barajas Airport, were obtained from three separate databases and analyzed separately (in three databases). To predict turnaround performance, this paper also introduces a predictor dependent variable called "star values" as a measure of minimal delay conditions in order to predict time performance. The analysis shows that the proposed method unveils a new approach in determining how collaborative performance can be measured in the TAP and the predicted key performance indicators, which shows variations in the predicted CDM indicators. Results challenge managers and policymakers to find which improvements can be enacted for better usage of airport infrastructures and resources for optimum use as well as enhanced TAP. In terms of theory use and extension, the study reveals how CDM is an essential element in the literature on air traffic management. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Competitive colonization of prosthetic surfaces by staphylococcus aureus and human cells	JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS RESEARCH PART A			English	Article						biomaterial; bacterial adherence; biofilm; cellular oxidative stress; race for the surface	BIOMATERIAL-CENTERED INFECTION; MICROBIAL BIOFILM GROWTH; TISSUE INTEGRATION; IN-VITRO; BACTERIAL ADHESION; IMPLANT MATERIALS; HUMAN OSTEOBLASTS; OXIDATIVE STRESS; APOPTOSIS; EPIDERMIDIS	Implantation of a biomaterial provides an adhesion substratum both to host cell integration and to contaminating bacteria. We studied simultaneous competitive adhesion of Staphylococcus aureus in serial 1:10 dilutions of 10(8) colony forming units (CFU)/mL and human osteogenic sarcoma (SaOS-2) or primary osteoblast (hOB) cells, both 1x10(5)cells/mL, to the surfaces of titanium, polydimethylsiloxane and polystyrene. The bacterial adherence and human cell proliferation, cytotoxicity and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were studied using fluorometric (fluorescent microscopy and flow cytometry) and colorimetric methods (MTT, LDH and crystal violet). The bacterial cell viability was also evaluated using the drop plate method. The presence of bacteria resulted in reduced adherence of human cells to the surface of the biomaterials, increased production of ROS, and into increased apoptosis. On the other hand, the presence of either type of human cells was associated with a reduction of bacterial colonization of the biomaterial with Staphylococcus aureus. These results suggest that increasing colonization of the biomaterial surface in vitro by one negatively affects colonization by the other. Host cell integration to an implant surface reduces bacterial contamination, which opens novel opportunities for the design of infection-resistant biomaterials in current implantology and future regenerative medicine.

The study was performed using male Wistar rats of 3 (control), 12, and 24 months and 3-month-old rats treated with CH, melatonin, and CH plus melatonin. We found that pineal eEF-2 is affected by aging and CH, these changes being prevented by exogenous melatonin in the case of CH-treated rats. The proteomic studies show that many other proteins are affected by aging and oxidative stress in the pineal gland. The results suggest that one of the possible mechanisms underlying pineal gland dysfunction during aging is the effect of lipid peroxidation on eEF-2, which is a key component of protein synthesis machinery.

This paper develops a method for selecting the window size for forecasting. Our proposed method is to choose the optimal size that minimizes the forecaster's quadratic loss function, and we prove the asymptotic validity of our approach. Our Monte Carlo experiments show that our method performs well under various types of structural changes. When applied to forecasting US real output growth and inflation, the proposed method tends to improve upon conventional methods, especially for output growth. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The influence of birth weight amongst 33-35 weeks gestational age (wGA) infants on the risk of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) hospitalisation: a pooled analysis	JOURNAL OF MATERNAL-FETAL & NEONATAL MEDICINE			English	Article						Bronchiolitis; lower respiratory tract infection; moderate preterm; prematurity; risk factors	INFECTION REQUIRING HOSPITALIZATION; HEALTHY PRETERM INFANTS; PREMATURE-INFANTS; LUNG-FUNCTION; PREDICT HOSPITALIZATION; BORN; GROWTH; MODEL; VALIDATION; MORBIDITY	Objective: To investigate the association between birth weight and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) hospitalisation during the first year of life in 33 degrees-35(6) weeks' gestational age (wGA) infants.Study design: Pooled analysis of data (n=1218) from Spain, Germany, France and Italy.Result: RSV hospitalised infants overall had a significantly higher birth weight than non-hospitalised infants (2.24 versus 2.14kg; p<0.001) for both males (2.25 versus 2.18kg; p=0.049) and females (2.22 versus 2.11kg, p=0.007). The effect was significant only in 34 wGA infants (33 wGA: hospitalised 1.95kg versus non-hospitalised 1.95kg, p=0.976; 34 wGA: 2.26 versus 2.14kg, p=0.007; 35 wGA: 2.37 versus 2.29kg, p=0.070), particularly female 34 wGA infants (female: 2.24 versus 2.08kg, p=0.019; male: 2.27 versus 2.20, p=0.191). Birth weight was shown to be an independent risk factor for RSV hospitalisation.Conclusions: In 33-35 wGA infants, a higher birth weight appeared independently associated with an increased risk of RSV hospitalisation.

Journal of Maternal-Fetal & Neonatal Medicine			English	Article						Cardiotocography; fetal heart rate decelerations; neonatal acidemia; neonatal outcomes	FETAL HEART-RATE; VARIABLE DECELERATIONS; ACIDEMIA; GUIDELINES; CONSENSUS; DELIVERY; LABOR; AREA	Objective: To estimate the association between atypical variable decelerations and neonatal acidemia.Method: We conducted a one-year case-control study comparing the last thirty minutes before delivery of fetal heart rate tracings of 102 acidemic neonates (umbilical arterial cord gas pH7.10) with 100 non-acidemic controls (umbilical arterial cord gas pH>7.10). Incidence of atypical features and total number of decelerations, number of atypical decelerations, number of slow return decelerations and number of decelerations with loss of moderate variability during deceleration were extracted. We estimated the association between atypical features, neonatal acidemia and neonatal morbidity.Results: Acidemic neonates showed a larger number of atypical decelerations (4 [0-12] vs. 3 [0-10]), slow return decelerations (4 [0-11] vs. 1 [0-10]) and decelerations with non-moderate variability (0[0-12] vs. 0 [0-6]) compared to non-acidemic controls. Slow return was significantly associated with an increased risk of acidemia at birth (OR 4.46; CI 95%: 2.18 - 9.15) Slow return was the most discriminating feature between groups with an AUC: 0.745.Conclusion: Certain atypical features, as slow return and loss of moderate variability within decelerations are associated with neonatal acidemia. Slow return could help in the gradation of acidemia risk levels, as an indicator of gravity.

Tropospheric emissions: Monitoring of pollution (TEMPO)	JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER			English	Article							ROTATIONAL RAMAN-SCATTERING; BACKSCATTER ULTRAVIOLET MEASUREMENTS; OZONE PROFILE RETRIEVALS; SURFACE UV IRRADIANCE; SATELLITE-OBSERVATIONS; AIR-QUALITY; NO2 RETRIEVAL; FORMALDEHYDE COLUMNS; GLOBAL OBSERVATIONS; CLOUD PRESSURES	TEMPO was selected in 2012 by NASA as the first Earth Venture Instrument, for launch between 2018 and 2021. It will measure atmospheric pollution for greater North America from space using ultraviolet and visible spectroscopy. TEMPO observes from Mexico City, Cuba, and the Bahamas to the Canadian oil sands, and from the Atlantic to the Pacific, hourly and at high spatial resolution (similar to 2.1 km N/S x 4.4 km E/W at 36.5 degrees N, 100 degrees W). TEMPO provides a tropospheric measurement suite that includes the key elements of tropospheric air pollution chemistry, as well as contributing to carbon cycle knowledge. Measurements are made hourly from geostationary (GEO) orbit, to capture the high variability present in the diurnal cycle of emissions and chemistry that are unobservable from current low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites that measure once per day. The small product spatial footprint resolves pollution sources at sub-urban scale. Together, this temporal and spatial resolution improves emission inventories, monitors population exposure, and enables effective emission-control strategies. TEMPO takes advantage of a commercial GEO host spacecraft to provide a modest cost mission that measures the spectra required to retrieve ozone (O-3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), formaldehyde (H2CO), glyoxal (C2H2O2), bromine monoxide (BrO), IO (iodine monoxide), water vapor, aerosols, cloud parameters, ultraviolet radiation, and foliage properties. TEMPO thus measures the major elements, directly or by proxy, in the tropospheric O-3 chemistry cycle. Multi-spectral observations provide sensitivity to O-3 in the lowermost troposphere, substantially reducing uncertainty in air quality predictions. TEMPO quantifies and tracks the evolution of aerosol loading. It provides these near-realtime air quality products that will be made publicly available. TEMPO will launch at a prime time to be the North American component of the global geostationary constellation of pollution monitoring together with the European Sentinel-4 (S4) and Korean Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS) instruments.

Each was taking measurements between February 2004 and April 2012 (ACE-FTS and MLS are currently operational), providing hundreds of profile coincidences in the Northern and Southern hemispheres, and during local morning and evening. Focusing on determining diurnal and hemispheric biases in the ACE-FTS data, this study compares ACE-FTS version 3.5 profiles that are collocated with MIPAS and MLS, and analyzes the differences between instrument retrievals for Northern and Southern hemispheres and for local morning and evening data. For O-3, ACE-FTS is typically within 5% of mid-stratospheric MIPAS and MLS data and exhibits a positive bias of similar to 10 to 20% in the upper stratosphere - lower mesosphere. For H2O, ACEFTS exhibits an average bias of 5% between 20 and 60 km. For N2O, ACE-FTS agrees with MIPAS and MLS within 20 to +10% up to 45 km and 35 km, respectively. For HNO3, ACEFTS typically agrees within +/- 10% below 30 km, and exhibits a positive bias of similar to 10 to 20% above 30 km. With respect to MIPAS CO, ACE-FTS exhibits an average - 11% bias between 28 and 50 km, and at higher altitudes a positive bias on the order of 10% ( > 100%) in the winter (summer). With respect to winter MLS CO, ACE-FTS is typically within 10% between 25 and 40 km, and has an average bias of - 11% above 40 km. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Haitzer, T; Navarro, E; Zdun, U				Haitzer, Thomas; Navarro, Elena; Zdun, Uwe			Reconciling software architecture and source code in support of software evolution	JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE			English	Article						Components; ADLs; Architecture reconstruction; Evolution styles; M2M transformation; Architectural knowledge	KNOWLEDGE; DESIGN	Even in the eighties, the need of managing software evolution has been detected as one of the most complex aspects of the software lifecycle. In this context, software architecture has been highlighted as an integral element of the software evolution process. However, no matter how much effort is put into the architecture, it must eventually be translated into source code. The potential misalignment between architecture and code can lead to failures in the evolution process in terms of economic impacts, failed expectations, and so on. In this article we report on a design science research study that we pursued to answer three research questions. First, we have studied whether and in how far it is possible to design an approach that both enforces the integration between software architecture and source code to avoid architectural erosion and architectural drift and, at the same time, provides automatic guidance to developers to carry out the required change tasks in each evolution steps. Second, we have studied whether this approach may be applied in realistic (open source) cases. Finally, we have analysed whether it is realizable at acceptable costs (in terms of development effort) in comparison to the overall development efforts roughly spent on the evolution of the projects in focus.

New challenges for the next generation of partitioned systems include the use of multiprocessor architectures and distribution standards in order to open up this technique to a heterogeneous set of emerging scenarios (e.g., cyber-physical systems). This work describes a system architecture that enables the use of data-centric distribution middleware in partitioned real-time embedded systems based on a hypervisor for multi-core, and it focuses on the analysis of the available architectural configurations. We also present an application-case study to evaluate and identify the possible trade-offs among the different configurations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Applying computational intelligence methods for predicting the sales of newly published books in a real editorial business management environment	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Book sales forecasting; Decision-aid models; Feature selection; Regression	EXTREME LEARNING-MACHINE; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; NEURAL-NETWORKS; FEATURE-SELECTION; MODELS; PERCEPTRON; PARAMETERS	When a new book is launched the publisher faces the problem of how many books should be printed for delivery to bookstores; printing too many is the main issue, since it implies a loss of investment due to inventory excess, but printing too few will also have a negative economic impact. In this paper, we are tackling the problem of predicting total sales in order to print the right amount of books and doing so even before the book has reached the stores. A real dataset including the complete sales data for books published in Spain across several years has been used. We have conducted an analysis in three stages: an initial exploratory analysis, by means of data visualisation techniques; a feature selection process, using different techniques to find out what are the variables that have more impact on sales; and a regression or prediction stage, in which a set of machine learning methods has been applied to create forecasting models for book sales. The obtained models are able to predict sales from pre-publication data with remarkable accuracy, and can be visualised as simple decision trees. Thus, these can be used as decision aid tools for publishers, which can provide a reliable guidance on the decision process of publishing a book. This is also shown in the paper by addressing four example cases of representative publishers, regarding their number of sales and the number of different books they sell. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, qualitative socio-cultural approaches are still limited, and therefore, ES important for people, are currently. not commonly captured. We performed 34 face-to-face semi-structured interviews to describe stakeholders' appreciation of ES from dehesa landscapes in northern Extremadura, Spain. A total of 45 ES were mentioned, and compared among different sectors and levels of governance. At the local level, people appreciated especially provisioning and cultural services. In contrast, regional level respondents showed more appreciation for regulating and supporting services, which included biodiversity conservation and climate regulation. Private and public sector respondents appreciated provisioning services more, whereas the civil sector mentioned supporting and regulating services more. For instance, water regulation was only mentioned by civil and public sector respondents, while genetic resource preservation was only expressed by the private sector. All sectors noted cultural services as key ES. We discuss most mentioned ES by respondents, the co-production nature of ES in wood-pastures, as well as cultural services as key ES of dehesas in coupled social-ecological systems. We conclude with policy recommendations drawn from the insights of this study. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This report describes the methods used to develop the Single-Case Reporting guideline In BEhavioural interventions (SCRIBE) 2016. As a result of 2 online surveys and a 2-day meeting of experts, the SCRIBE 2016 checklist was developed, which is a set of 26 items that authors need to address when writing about single-case research. This article complements the more detailed SCRIBE 2016 Explanation and Elaboration article (Tate et al., 2016) that provides a rationale for each of the items and examples of adequate reporting from the literature. Both these resources will assist authors to prepare reports of single-case research with clarity, completeness, accuracy, and transparency. They will also provide journal reviewers and editors with a practical checklist against which such reports may be critically evaluated. We recommend that the SCRIBE 2016 is used by authors preparing manuscripts describing single-case research for publication, as well as journal reviewers and editors who are evaluating such manuscripts.

Outcome of children with relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma: A meta-analysis of ITCC/SIOPEN European phase II clinical trials	PEDIATRIC BLOOD & CANCER			English	Article						neuroblastoma; phase II; refractory; relapse; temozolomide; topotecan	HIGH-RISK NEUROBLASTOMA; PEDIATRIC ONCOLOGY; TOPOTECAN; TEMOZOLOMIDE; THERAPIES; PROGRESS; CANCER	BackgroundFew randomized trials have been conducted in children with relapsed/refractory neuroblastoma and data about outcomes including progression-free survival (PFS) in these patients are scarce. ProcedureA meta-analysis of three phase II studies of children with relapsed/refractory neuroblastoma conducted in Europe (temozolomide, topotecan-vincristine-doxorubicin and topotecan-temozolomide) was performed. Individual patient data with extended follow-up were collected from the trial databases after publication to describe trial outcomes (response rate, clinical benefit ratio, duration of treatment, PFS, and overall survival [OS]). Characteristics of subjects with relapsed/refractory neuroblastoma were compared. ResultsData from 71 children and adolescents with relapsed/refractory neuroblastoma were collected. Response definitions were not homogeneous in the three trials. Patients were on study for a median of 3.5 months (interquartile range [IQR] 1.9-6.2). Of those, 35.2% achieved a complete or partial response, 26.3% experienced a response after more than two cycles, and 23.9% received more than six cycles. Median PFS from study entry for all, refractory, and relapsed patients was 6.4 1.0, 12.5 +/- 6.8, and 5.7 +/- 1.0 months, respectively (P = 0.006). Median OS from study entry for all, refractory, and relapsed patients was 16.1 +/- 4.3, 27.9 +/- 20.2, and 11.0 +/- 1.6 months, respectively (P = 0.03). ConclusionsBaseline data for response rate, clinical benefit ratio, duration of treatment, PFS, and OS were provided. Two subpopulations (relapsed/refractory) were clearly distinct and should be included in the interpretation of all trials. These results should help informing the design of forthcoming studies in relapsed/refractory neuroblastoma.

The flexibility of the mid-size stellarator devices together with their unique diagnostic capabilities make them ideally suited to study the relation between magnetic topology, electric fields and transport. This paper addresses advances in the understanding of plasma transport in mid-size stellarators with an emphasis on the physics of flows, transport control, impurity and particle transport and fast particles. The results described here emphasize an improved physics understanding of phenomena in stellarators that complements the empirical approach. Experiments in mid-size stellarators support the development of advanced plasma scenarios in Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X) and, in concert with better physics understanding in tokamaks, may ultimately lead to an advance in the prediction of burning plasma behaviour.

The membranes were prepared via UV curing of the polymer dope followed by a non-solvent-induced phase separation process. Two different acrylic monomers were investigated and their amount was varied in the polymer dope, to study the influence of concentration on final results. High crosslinking degrees were achieved by irradiating the solution for one minute. Morphological investigations of the active surface and of the cross-sections of the fabricated membranes showed that the typical porosity of ultrafiltration membranes was obtained starting from solutions containing a low amount of crosslinker (10 wt%), which is consistent with the water flux values which were comparable to that of the pristine polysulfone membrane. High concentrations of crosslinker resin in the initial polymer dope produced denser membranes with lower permeability. High rejection of 27 nm particles (>90%) was measured for all samples having measurable flux. The addition of the crosslinker allowed one to obtain stability in various solvents without affecting the flux and rejection performance of the porous membranes.

Sixty-nine untrained volunteers assessed and rated twenty-five different commercial bottled and tap waters from. Water samples were physicochemical characterised by analysing conductivity, pH, total dissolved solids (TDS) and major anions and cations: HCO3-, SO42-, Cl-, NO3-, Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+ and K. Residual chlorine levels were also analysed in the tap water samples. Globally, volunteers preferred waters rich in calcium bicarbonate and sulfate, rather than in sodium chloride. This study also demonstrated that it was possible to accurately predict the overall liking by a Partial Least Squares regression using either all measured physicochemical parameters or a reduced number of them. These results were in agreement with previously published results using trained panellists.

The main problem of previously reported liquid chromatography-based methods for oleocanthal and oleacein measurement is their interaction with water or other polar solvents such as methanol to promote the formation of hemiacetal or acetal derivatives. This interaction can occur during either sample extraction, basically liquid-liquid extraction, and/or chromatographic separation. The aim of this research was to evaluate the suitability of LC-MS/MS for absolute quantitation of oleocanthal and oleacein in VOO. For this purpose, both liquid liquid extraction and chromatographic separation were studied as potential promoters of acetals and hemiacetals formation from oleocanthal and/or oleacein. The results showed that the use of methanol water solutions for phenols extraction was not influential on the formation of these artifacts. Acetals and hemiacetals from oleocanthal and/or oleacein were only detected at very low concentrations when methanol gradients under acidic conditions were used for chromatographic separation. With this premise, a protocol based on extraction with acetonitrile and a reverse chromatographic gradient with methanol was established to quantify in absolute terms oleocanthal and oleacein in VOO samples. The resulting protocol was applied to three VOO samples characterized by high, medium, and low levels of these two phenols.

The new support (Tiss (R)-OH) is a 100 mu m thickness sheet nanofiber membrane manufactured by electrospinning and composed by acrylic nanofibers. It has been used in an electromembrane extraction (EME) combined with a HPLC procedure using diode array detection. The proposed method has been used for the extraction of four high polarity acidic compounds: nicotinic acid, amoxicillin, hippuric acid and salicylic acid. Analytes were extracted from an aqueous sample solution (pH 4) (donor phase) using a Tiss (R)-OH sheet that supports a 5% (w/v) Aliquat (R) 336 in 1-octanol liquid membrane. Aqueous solution (pH 6) was used as acceptor phase. The electrical field was generated from a d.c. electrical current of 100 V through two spiral shaped platinum wires placed into donor and acceptor phases. Analytes were extracted in 10 min with recoveries in the 60-85% range. The proposed EME procedure has been successfully applied to the determination of the target analytes in human urine samples.

Sensory classification of table olives using an electronic tongue: Analysis of aqueous pastes and brines	TALANTA			English	Article						Electronic tongue; Table olives; Sensory defects; Trade category classification; Linear discriminant analysis; Simulated annealing algorithm	VOLATILE COMPOUNDS; SALT MIXTURES; DATA FUSION; FERMENTATION; PROFILE; DISCRIMINATION; COMPONENTS; CULTIVAR; STARTER; QUALITY	Table olives are highly appreciated and consumed worldwide. Different aspects are used for trade category classification being the sensory assessment of negative defects present in the olives and brines one of the most important. The trade category quality classification must follow the International Olive Council directives, requiring the organoleptic assessment of defects by a trained sensory panel. However, the training process is a hard, complex and sometimes subjective task, being the low number of samples that can be evaluated per day a major drawback considering the real needs of the olive industry. In this context, the development of electronic tongues as taste sensors for defects' sensory evaluation is of utmost relevance. So, an electronic tongue was used for table olives classification according to the presence and intensity of negative defects. Linear discrimination models were established based on sub-sets of sensor signals selected by a simulated annealing algorithm. The predictive potential of the novel approach was first demonstrated for standard solutions of chemical compounds that mimic butyric, putrid and zapateria defects (>= 93% for cross-validation procedures). Then its applicability was verified; using reference table olives/brine solutions samples identified with a single intense negative attribute, namely butyric, musty, putrid, zapateria or winey vinegary defects (>= 93% cross-validation procedures). Finally, the E-tongue coupled with the same chemometric approach was applied to classify table olive samples according to the trade commercial categories (extra, 1st choice, 2nd choice and unsuitable for consumption) and an additional quality category (extra free of defects), established based on sensory analysis data. Despite the heterogeneity of the samples studied and number of different sensory defects perceived, the predictive linear discriminant model established showed sensitivities greater than 86%. So, the overall performance achieved showed that the electrochemical device could be used as a taste sensor for table olives organoleptic trade successful classification, allowing a preliminary quality assessment, which could facilitate, in the future, the complex task of sensory panelists.

Electronic tongues to assess wine sensory descriptors	TALANTA			English	Article						Electronic tongue; Voltammetric sensors; Partial least squares regression; Wine; Sensory panel; Ageing	SYSTEMS; ARRAYS	This work reports the application of an electronic tongue as a tool towards the analysis of wine in tasks such as its discrimination based on the maturing in barrels or the prediction of the global scores assigned by a sensory panel. To this aim, red wine samples were first analysed with the voltammetric sensor array, without performing any sample pretreatment. Afterwards, obtained responses were preprocessed employing fast Fourier transform (FFT) for the compression and reduction of signal complexity, and obtained coefficients were then used as inputs to build the qualitative and quantitative models employing either linear discriminant analysis (LDA) or partial least squares regression (PLS), respectively. Satisfactory results were obtained overall, with a classification rate of 100% in the discrimination of the type of barrel used during wine maturing, a normalized NRMSE of 0.077 in the estimation of ageing time (months) or 0.11 in the prediction of the scores (0-10) from a trained sensory panel (all for the external test subset).

In such cases, accurate profiling of lipophilicity vs. pH, which plays a fundamental role in drug pharmacoidnetics, might be complex. In the present work two common lipophilicity determination methods based on the drug distribution between 1-octanol and aqueous buffer i.e. phase equilibration (shake-flask) and two-phase titration (potentiometry), were compared with a high-throughput lipophilicity index, the Chromatographic Hydrophobicity Index (CHI). The results were also compared with log Dow pH-profiles calculated by different algorithms from ACD/Labs. Accurate and similar results were obtained for both octanol-water approaches but, due to the lower determination times and the absence of different ion-pairing buffers, potentiometry was shown to be the most convenient method. CHI vs. pH profiles provide rapid and efficient information, which is very convenient for lipophilicity screening purposes, but may differ slightly from shake-flask and potentiometric results.

After separation by means of a magnetic field, the solid phase is directly introduced into an electrothermal atomizer for antimony determination. Alternatively, the solid can be slurried and then injected into the atomizer. In all cases, palladium nitrate is used as a chemical modifier. The preconcentration factors are close to 205 and 325, with detection limits of 0.02 and 0.03 mu g L-1 antimony, for the slurry and solid sampling procedures, respectively. Speciation of Sb(III) and Sb(V) is achieved by means of two extractions carried out at different acidity. The results for total antimony are verified using certified reference materials. Water samples are analyzed for antimony speciation.

The method proposed is based on addition of 400 mu g Ca as molecule forming reagent and of 20 mu g Pd as chemical modifier, which helps to stabilize the analyte and enhances sensitivity. The molecular spectrum for CaCl offers different lines with different limits of detection and linear ranges, which permitted to analyze solid samples with different Cl contents. The lowest limit of detection (0.75 ng Cl, corresponding to 0.75 mu g g(-1) for a typical sample mass of 1 mg) could be achieved by combination of three of the most sensitive lines in the vicinity of 620.862 nm, while the amplest linear range (up to 860 ng Cl) was achieved by selection of the less sensitive line at 377.501 nm. The method developed enabled the direct determination of Cl in solid samples using simple external calibration with aqueous standards. Good precision (5-9% RSD) and accuracy was attained in a series of certified samples of very different nature (i.e. coal, iron oxide, polyethylene, human hair, pine needles, rice flour and milk) and with very different Cl contents, ranging from about 50 mu g g(-1) to 1% (w/w) Cl. The method appears as particularly useful for Cl determination in samples with elevated Ca contents, for which biased results with other diatomic molecules, such as AlCl or SrCl, may be obtained.

It is based on the use of Fourier Transform Near Infrared (FT-NIR) diffuse reflectance measurements. The method permits a fast, cheap and green analytical way, to understand postmortem degradation of bones caused by the environment conditions on different skeletal parts and to select the best preserved bone samples. Samples, from the Late Roman Necropolis of Virgen de la Misericordia street and En Gil street located in Valencia (Spain), were employed to test the proposed approach being determined calcium, magnesium and strontium in bone remains and sediments. Coefficients of determination obtained between predicted values and reference ones for Ca, Mg and Sr were 90.4, 97.3 and 97.4, with residual predictive deviation of 3.2, 5.3 and 2.3, respectively, and relative root mean square error of prediction between 10% and 37%. Results obtained evidenced that NIR spectra combined with statistical analysis can help to predict bone mineral profiles suitable to evaluate bone diagenesis.

Fourteen NADESs were prepared by combining two natural primary metabolites and water. Studies on NADES viscosity and gluten solubilisation in NADESs and ethanol-water solutions (for comparison purposes) werecarried out. Different strategies for speeding-up gluten solubilisation in NADESs were evaluated: dilution, temperature and sonication by a cup-horn sonoreactor. Diluted fructose-citric acid NADES and sonication were finally selected for gluten solubilisation. Solubilised proteins were characterized by electrophoresis and molecular fluorescence. The proposed procedure was also assessed in real samples, especially ultrasound time. Kit solvents (including reducing agents) were replaced by NADES, and hence, a reassessing of immunoassay system was necessary. Samples with and without gluten as well as recovery tests were used for this purpose. Recoveries were in the range of 79-106% and the repeatability, expressed as relative standard deviation, was better than 15%.

Fluorescein-labelled derivatives of target antigens (tracers) were synthesised and purified by thin layer chromatography. Influence of tracer structures on the assay parameters was investigated. For KM and TF, the best assay performance was achieved with the homologous pairs of reagents. For the PC assay, the heterologous tracer, i.e. fluorescein-labelled derivative of TF, was used. The developed FPIAs were applied to the determination of KM, TF and PC in red wine. Most optimal sample preparation was achieved with cross-linked poly(vinylpyrrolidone) as a sorbent. This clean-up is simple, rapid and allows determination of all three strobilurin fungicides in one sample. Detection limits of the developed FPIAs in red wine were 28, 6 and 5 ng/mL for KM, TF and PC, respectively. Recovery in spiked samples averaged between 80% and 104%. Intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variance were less than 12%. The developed FPIA methods can be applied to screening of wine samples for KM, TF and PC residues without complicated cleanup.

This work aimed to evaluate two hand-held portable NIR spectrophotometers for on-site and real time analysis of nutritive parameters in raw compound feed: Phazir 1624 Polychromix Inc (PhIR) and MicroNIR (TM) 1700 by JDSU (MICRO). For computing data, different combinations of pre-treatments and multivariate statistical methods have been assayed to extract the valuable information of spectra data and to develop appropriate calibrations. The calibration models displayed greatest predictive capacity for Crude Protein (CP), Crude Fiber (CF) and Starch (STCH) and the determination coefficients of cross validation were 0.90-0.88 for CP, 0.85-0.91 for CF, 0.89-0.88 and 0.89-0.91 for STCH using PhIR and MICRO instruments respectively. Dry Matter showed the lowest determination coefficients of cross validation 0.67-0.73. Accuracy achieved 99-101% for both NIRS instruments and no differences were found when applying t(student)-test comparing reference and predicted data. Results obtained with both instruments were compared by using standard deviation and not significant differences were observed at the 5% level. Results so far have demonstrated the potential of these handheld NIRS instruments proposed here to estimate the individual compound feeds composition changes at farms level instantly, time avoiding the disadvantage of moving the samples to the lab.

The combination of this material with a Direct Mercury Analyser (DMA80) has overcome important limitations of this equipment for mercury determination of complex matrix samples, like high saline content, due to the ability of this material to selective and efficient mercury retention. Furthermore, application for fast screening of mercury species in food samples, like fish, is also presented. The polymer material has been synthesized by the precipitation technique, using Azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) as initiator, 2-(Methacryloylamino) ethyl 2-Methyl Acrylate (NOBE) as cross-linker, and 1-phenyl-3-(-3-vinyl phenyl) thiourea as monomer. It has been characterized by SEM, TGA, FTIR, and binding isotherms have been established through Langmuir and Freundlich models. Selectivity has been proven by carrying out cross-reactivity experiments.

Due to their complexity, the analysis of bodily fluids on superabsorbent pads is certainly difficult. In this study, semen, vaginal fluid and urine stains placed on superabsorbent pads including sanitary napkins, panty-liners and diapers were non-destructively detected by Attenuated Total Reflectance (ATR) Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). In spite of the higher absorbent capacity of the lower layers, this technique was able to detect the three fluids on the upper layer of all pads, showing that bodily fluids are distributed within all layers. Additionally, mixtures of these bodily fluids prepared on superabsorbent pads and cotton were studied, since real forensic investigations involving sexual abuse cases usually deal with mixtures of these fluids. Due to their IR marked protein region (1800-1480 cm(-1)), semen and vaginal fluid were easily distinguished from urine. However, since semen and vaginal fluid have both a high protein composition, that region of their IR signatures were quite similar, except for slight visual differences, that should be further analysed. Therefore, we propose ATR-FTIR as a suitable, presumptive, non-destructive and rapid approach to detect stains of human bodily fluids on the upper layer of superabsorbent pads from sexual crimes.

The extraction parameters were studied, and the most favourable conditions were selected. The analytical features of the method were calculated: matrix effect, accuracy (ranged from 90% to 111%), repeatability and intermediate precision (RSD < 10%), detection and quantification limits of the method (ranged from 0.001 mu g g(-1) (DOP) to 0.142 mu g g(-1) (DEP)), and satisfactory results were obtained. Major advantages of this approach are low consumption of reagents and solvents, no clean-up or evaporation steps were required and minimum sample manipulation. In addition, cross contamination from glassware, solvents and samples is minimized, thus procedural blanks are keeping to a minimum.. The applicability of the proposed method was demonstrated analysing sediment samples from Galician coast (NW Spain). The proposed method allows the application in routine laboratory conditions and its implementation in environmental monitoring studies under the European Water Framework Directive (WFD) and Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD).

We performed a systematic review of empirical studies featuring analyses of mindfulness in teaching contexts. Databases were reviewed from the start of records to January 2016. Eligibility criteria included empirical analyses of mindfulness, mental health, wellbeing, and performance outcomes acquired in relation to practice. A total of 19 papers met the eligibility criteria and were included in the systematic review, consisting of a total 1981 participants. Studies were principally examined for outcomes such as burnout, anxiety, depression and stress, as well as more positive wellbeing measures (e.g., life satisfaction). The systematic review revealed that mindfulness was generally associated with positive outcomes in relation to most measures. However, the quality of the studies was inconsistent, and so further research is needed, particularly involving high-quality randomised control trials. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This article shows that paintings on linen are a form of artistic expression that is well documented in antiquity, and that they represent a primary source for the study of the work done by painters who specialized in funerary art. The best preserved and largest surviving ancient collection of paintings on cloth comes from Egypt. It is a practice that is closely tied to funerary customs, as is documented from prehistoric times, and that reached its maximum extension during the Roman period.

Recently, we have discovered that a derivative of the frog skin AMP esculentin-1a, Esc(1-21), is highly potent against both free living and biofilm forms of the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. However, bringing AMPs into clinics requires to overcome their low stability, high toxicity and inefficient delivery to the target site at high concentrations. Importantly, peptide conjugation to gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), which are among the most applied inorganic nanocarriers in biomedical sciences, represents a valuable strategy to solve these problems. Here we report that covalent conjugation of Esc(1-21) to soluble AuNPs [AuNPs@Esc(1-21)] via a poly(ethylene glycol) linker increased by similar to 15-fold the activity of the free peptide against the motile and sessile forms of P. aeruginosa without being toxic to human keratinocytes. Furthermore, AuNPs@Esc(1-21) resulted to be significantly more resistant to proteolytic digestion and to disintegrate the bacterial membrane at very low concentration (5 nM). Finally, we demonstrated for the first time the capability of peptide-coated AuNPs to display a wound healing activity on a keratinocytes monolayer. Overall, these findings suggest that our engineered AuNPs can serve as attractive novel biological-derived material for topical treatment of epithelial infections and healing of the injured tissue. Statement of Significance Despite conjugation of AMPs to AuNPs represents a worthwhile solution to face some limitations for their development as new therapeutics, only a very limited number of studies is available on peptide-coated AuNPs. Importantly, this is the first report showing that a covalent binding of a linear AMP via a poly (ethylene glycol) linker to AuNPs highly enhances antipseudomonal activity, preserving the same mode of action of the free peptide, without being harmful. Furthermore, AuNPs@Esc(1-21) are expected to accelerate recovery of an injured skin layer. All together, these findings suggest our peptide-coated AuNPs as attractive novel nanoscale formulation to treat bacterial infections and to heal the injured tissue. (C) 2016 Acta Materialia Inc.

We apply clustering techniques to endogenously determine how similar countries are with respect to the HDI, and into how many categories they can be classified. We find that, in contrast to the usual assumption in the United Nations' Human Development Reports, the number of categories is not fixed and has varied over time, from three in 1990 to four in 2014. We also find that the countries within each category differ from the United Nation's proposal.

Symbolic search with Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) performs efficient state space exploration in terms of time and memory. This is crucial in optimal settings, in which large parts of the state space must be explored in order to prove optimality. However, the development of accurate heuristics for explicit-state search in recent years have left symbolic search techniques in a secondary place. In this article we propose two orthogonal improvements for symbolic search planning. On the one hand, we analyze and compare different methods for image computation in order to efficiently perform the successor generation on symbolic search. Image computation is the main bottleneck of symbolic search algorithms so an efficient computation is paramount for efficient symbolic search planning. On the other hand, we study how to use state-invariant constraints to prune states in symbolic search. This is essential in regression search but it is yet to be exploited in symbolic search planners. Experiments with symbolic bidirectional uniform-cost search and symbolic A* search with PDB5 show remarkable performance improvements on most IPC benchmark domains.

With the great success of developing such tools, mitochondria, once originated from bacteria, can be effectively targeted by antibiotics. For that reason, some studies propose antibiotics-targeting of mitochondria as part of anticancer therapy. Here, we have focused on the effects of various classes of antibiotics on mitochondria in cancer and non-cancer cells and demonlow mitochondrial membrane potential, reduced ATP production, altered morphology and lowered respiration rate which altogether suggested mitochondrial dysfunction (MDF). This was in parallel with increased level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and decreased activity of mitochondria( respiration complexes. However, both survival and repopulation capacity of cancer cells was not significantly affected by the antibiotics, perhaps due to a glycolytic shift or activated autophagy. In turn, simultaneous inhibition of autophagy and treatment with antibiotics largely reduced tumorigenic properties of cancer cells suggesting potential strategy for anticancer therapy.

To facilitate the separation of the catalysts from the reaction mixture MWCNT5 were modified by incorporating magnetic nanoparticles. For comparison, the composites of MWCNTO with magnetic nanoparticles were further modified by deposition of niobia in two loadings, e.g. 30 and 60 wt.%. Depending of the functionality the catalysts exposed preponderantly either Bronsted (mu-CNT-SO3H) or Lewis (GO@SO3CF3) acid sites. Deposition of niobia also led to catalysts with acid properties, but as a function of the precursor nature and loading, they exposed niobia phases with either Bronsted (e.g., Nb-0 units) or Lewis acid sites (e.g., -Nb = O units) in excess. Catalytic performances, in terms of the yields in one of the platform molecule (ie, levulinic acid versus lactic acid) were directly correlated with the nature of these acid sites. Interestingly enough, the catalysts showing high efficiency for lactic acid led also to high efficiency for the synthesis of succinic acid under pressure of molecular oxygen. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

National and international (WHO, CLSI) guidelines recommend that the order of draw of blood during phlebotomy should be blood culture/sterile tubes, then plain tubes/gel tubes, then tubes containing additives. This prevents contamination of sample tubes with additives from previous tubes that could cause erroneous results. There have been a number of studies recently looking at whether order of draw remains a problem with modern phlebotomy techniques and materials, or it is an outdated practice followed simply because of historical reasons. In the following article, the European Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine Working Group for the Preanalytical Phase (EFLM WG-PRE) provides an overview and summary of the literature with regards to order of draw in venous blood collection. Given the evidence presented in this article, the EFLM WG-PRE herein concludes that a significant frequency of sample contamination does occur if order of draw is not followed during blood collection and when performing venipuncture under less than ideal circumstances, thus putting patient safety at risk. Moreover, given that order of draw is not difficult to follow and knowing that ideal phlebotomy conditions and protocols are not always followed or possible, EFLM WG-PRE supports the continued recommendation of ensuring a correct order of draw for venous blood collection.

The aim of this study was to determine the serum activity of DPPIV, its expression on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and to examine possible correlations with disease activity (DAS28) in untreated patients with eRA. Methods: The study included 50 patients newly diagnosed with RA, who had not received any corticosteroid or disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD) therapy and whose conventional radiographs of hands and feet showed no structural damage. The control group consisted of 40 healthy volunteers. Also, 30 patients with chronic RA (cRA) were examined. The serum activity of DPPIV was determined by the direct photometric method, while expression of CD26 on PBMC was determined using flow cytometry. Results: Decreased DPPIV serum activity was detected in patients with eRA and cRA compared to the control group (p = 0.024, p < 0.0001, respectively). Although, the percentage of overall CD26+ white blood cells (WBC) was significantly decreased in eRA patients (p < 0.001), the percentage of CD26+ lymphocytes and monocytes and mean fluorescence intensity of CD26 on these cells in eRA patients showed no significant difference compared to healthy volunteers. DAS28 showed no significant correlation with CD26 expression or DPPIV serum activity, but a significant inverse correlation between the duration of symptoms and DPPIV serum activity was observed. Conclusions: Our results show that a decrease in DPPIV serum activity, but not CD26 expression, is present in an early stage of rheumatoid arthritis.

As wound healing is related to reactive oxygen species (ROS), this study was first conducted to evaluate the antioxidant activity of AHE by DPPH radical-scavenging, beta-carotene-linoleate bleaching, and reducing power assays. The major volatile compounds of AHE were lawsone, dimethyl sulfoxide, dimethyl sulfide, eugenol and maltol. The finding of the study showed that the incorporation of AHE into gelatin gels and films enhanced the antioxidant activity in a dose-dependent manner. In the wound-healing study, topical application of gelatin hydrogels or films enriched by AHE, on the wound site in a rat model, enhanced significantly wound healing activity and helped to prevent from inflammation damage, when compared to the control and CICAFLORA (R)-treated groups. Further, all preparations were found to improve the antioxidant status of treated rats as was evidenced by increased antioxidant enzymatic activities and reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) content. The increase in the activities of catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and gluthatione peroxydase (GPx) in wound tissues revealed that some bioactive compounds in AHE are able to enhance the healing of wounds by reducing the damage caused by ROS. Wound-healing activity was confirmed by histopathology studies. The obtained results showed that the addition of AHE to the gelatin matrix could improve the wound healing activity.

In fact, the fast increasing size and volatility of this knowledge has reached a point in which it is unrealistic to expect that system engineers can keep up to date with it. The most prominent paradigm for addressing this problem is the use of security patterns to communicate security knowledge from experts to system designers. This, and other security artifacts, have proved their utility and benefits in the past years, improving the way security is taken into account by system engineers and developers. On the other hand, these artifacts have some limitations that have prevented them from becoming more widespread. In particular, security patterns are human-oriented and as such heavily based on natural language, which implies intrinsic high degrees of imprecision and ambiguity. In our opinion, we need to make the move from purely human oriented artifacts to hybrid artifacts that convey information for both humans (engineers and designers) and computer tools (engineering and development environments). Therefore, we have created a new security knowledge representation artifact that aims to cover the needs of system engineers and help them not only in applying a solution, but also in understanding the security aspects of a given domain as a highly-related set of security concepts (e.g. properties, requirements, solutions, etc.). This artifact, called Domain Security Metamodel (DSM), is, as its name suggests, domain-specific and contains information about all security aspects that are relevant in a specific domain (e.g. embedded systems, web services, etc.). The DSM contains security solutions that implement the security properties of the specific domains. That way, when users apply them into their system models the solutions for development time can be integrated directly and naturally. In order to describe our approach in a useful way we use a running example based on the Web Service Security (WS-Security) specification. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In each market a local firm that operates in that market only competes against a global firm that operates in both markets. Local firms produce higher-quality goods than the global firm. If the quality levels of the local firms' products are the same, price discrimination is never welfare-decreasing. If they differ, discrimination is welfare-increasing if quantity increases. Because of a positive allocation effect of price discrimination, there are parameter values such that welfare increases while total output decreases with price discrimination.

Using a sample of 100 SMEs in Peru, we find that firms compete abroad with standardized products, which are conditioned by the host-country markets, human capital, and industry cooperation.

A fuzzy-logic-based controller for methane production in anaerobic fixed-film reactors	ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Anaerobic fixed-bed reactor; fuzzy-logic control; methane; pilot scale; winery wastewater	WASTE-WATER; DIGESTION; SYSTEMS	The main objective of this work was to develop a controller for biogas production in continuous anaerobic fixed-bed reactors, which used effluent total volatile fatty acids (VFA) concentration as control input in order to prevent process acidification at closed loop. To this aim, a fuzzy-logic-based control system was developed, tuned and validated in an anaerobic fixed-bed reactor at pilot scale that treated industrial winery wastewater. The proposed controller varied the flow rate of wastewater entering the system as a function of the gaseous outflow rate of methane and VFA concentration. Simulation results show that the proposed controller is capable to achieve great process stability even when operating at high VFA concentrations. Pilot results showed the potential of this control approach to maintain the process working properly under similar conditions to the ones expected at full-scale plants.

Determination of the symbolic base inertial parameters of planar mechanisms	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MECHANICS A-SOLIDS			English	Article						Base parameters; Inertial parameters; Symbolic; Model reduction	DYNAMIC PARAMETERS; IDENTIFICATION; MANIPULATOR; ROBOTS	The inertial information of a planar mechanical system is characterised using 4 inertial parameters per solid. Due to the kinematic constraints, this parametrisation turns out be redundant. In order to reduce the computational cost of the model and make it possible to estimate its inertial parameters, the model is usually written in terms of a minimum set of inertial parameters called base inertial parameters. These parameters completely determine the dynamics of motion (kinetics) of a mechanism and, since their contributions are independent to each other, their actual values can be estimated experimentally. The base inertial parameters expressions can be written as a linear combination of the inertial parameters and determining their symbolic expressions provides a deeper insight into their physical meaning. This paper presents a new algorithm to determine the symbolic expressions of the base inertial parameters of planar mechanisms. The approach is based on a very well known numerical method to obtain the base inertial parameters and on the fact that these parameters belong to a class of functions that lets us search for symbolic expressions matching with them. Since the symbolic expressions are a function of the geometric constants of the system, the presented algorithm constitutes a very valuable tool in design optimisation and it is also very interesting in dynamic parameter estimation, model reduction and other fields.

At each node, two thickness parameters are connected to the constitutive laws by a linear system. The zero out-of-plane normal stress condition is satisfied at the constitutive level using the normal strain as unknown in all integration points. Assumed in-plane strains based on least-squares are introduced as an alternative to the enhanced-assumed-strain (EAS) formulations and, contrasting with these, the result is an element satisfying ab-initio both the in plane and the transverse Patch tests. There are no additional degrees-of-freedom, as it is the case with EAS, even by means of static condensation. Least-squares fit allows the derivation of invariant finite strain elements which are shear-locking free and amenable to be incorporated in commercial codes. With that goal, we use automatically generated code produced by AceGen and Mathematica. Full assessment of the element formulation and the two-parameter thickness variation methodology is accomplished. Alternative thickness variation algorithms are tested. All benchmarks show very competitive results, similar to the best available enriched shell elements. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

This study deals with the distribution and morphometric characteristics of microforms features developed by cyanobacteria (Rivularia sp.) on coastal limestone outcrops. These coastal microforms, known as biopits, have a small rounded basin shape a few millimetres in size. Environmental and geological data were collected from 100 random rock surface spots from Punta des Farallo cape (Mallorca, Western Mediterranean), from which major controls on the spatial distribution of biopits were established. Additionally, morphological data on 382 biopits determined the diagnostic morphometry of these features and their enlargement mechanisms. The results indicated that biopits exhibit a preferential location in shaded exposures and sheltered areas from prevailing winds and waves, avoiding direct insolation and desiccation. Other major controls on these microforms location and development were variables such as the rock surface slope and the distance to the coast (i.e. influence of splash and spray). Shadow spots displayed higher biopits density than other locations according to the patterns determined by environmental and geomorphological factors at the study site. Morphometric analyses showed that biopits have a width twice their depth. The average width of the microforms was 6.49 +/- 2.40 mm and the average depth 2.46 +/- 1.09 mm. Most frequently, the width/depth ratio was 2 or larger. This characteristic shape ratio was an additional factor that plays a role in maintaining the necessary humidity for microorganisms associated with biopits. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Using these data, we characterized DOC dynamics in the different hydrological compartments and analysed the factors affecting them. We also analysed DOC dynamics during storm events and the factors that control DOC delivery to the stream. The results show some seasonality in rainwater and soil water DOC concentrations, while no clear seasonality was observed in stream water and groundwater, where DOC dynamics were strongly related to discharge and water table variations. For storm events with several discharge peaks, the slope of the discharge-DOC concentration relationship was higher for the first peak. The rather similar dynamics of stream water DOC concentration in all floods contrast with the observed diversity of hydrological processes. This raises the question of the origin of the observed rapid DOC increase.e	[Roig-Planasdemunt, Maria; Llorens, Pilar; Latron, Jerome] CSIC, Inst Environm Assessment & Water Res IDAEA, Barcelona, Spain	Latron, J (reprint author), CSIC, Inst Environm Assessment & Water Res IDAEA, Barcelona, Spain.	jerome.latron@idaea.csic.es	Llorens, Pilar/D-1046-2015	Llorens, Pilar/0000-0003-4591-5303; Latron, Jerome/0000-0003-3253-6734	Spanish Government [CGL2010-18374, CGL2013-43418]; CSIC; Ministry of Environment; FPI [BES-2011-045862]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness	This research was conducted with the support of the projects RespHiMed (CGL2010-18374) and EcoHyMed (CGL2013-43418) funded by the Spanish Government.

The crystalline trinuclear oxo-cluster has been obtained as crystalline powder and characterized by single-crystal and powder X-ray diffraction, elemental analysis, SEM, TGA, IR spectroscopy. Complex 2 composes of mu(3)-oxocentered trinuclear ruthenium array and exhibits the oxidation state delocalization between three Ru atoms at 293 K. Accurate single-crystal analysis along with valence bond calculations reveal trapped-valence state delocalization at room temperature, whereas three-site relaxation occurs at 100 K leading to Ru(II) and Ru-2(III) formal states. Moreover, the mixed valence of (RuRu2III)-Ru-II unit in compound 2 has been confirmed by XANES spectroscopy. The catalytic behavior of oxo-centered triruthenium complex 2 has been examined in hydration of nitriles and isomerization of allylic alcohols reactions both realized in aqueous media.

In such process, the interactions between a photosensitizer (PS) and a water oxidation catalyst (WOC) play a crucial role in the rates of photoinduced electron transfers, determining the overall quantum efficiency of the system. In this work, by means of Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) we investigate the nature of the aggregates between ruthenium polypyridine photo sensitizers (Rubpy and Ru(4)dend) and a tetraruthenium polyoxometalate (Ru4POM) water oxidation catalyst. Aggregate scattering is confirmed by the strong intensity-increase in the low-q regime, whereas the power law-fit of this region show slopes between 3 and 4, suggesting globular and porous aggregates. Intermolecular PS/WOC distances lower than 3 nm support the observed fast photoinduced electron transfers (<120 ps), however the proximity of the two components in the hybrids is also responsible for fast charge recombination. Approaches for inhibiting such undesired process are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Synthesis, characterisation and dynamic behavior of photoactive bipyridyl ruthenium(II)-nicotinamide complexes	INORGANICA CHIMICA ACTA			English	Article						Dynamic behavior; Polypyridyl Ru(II) complexes; Nicotinamide; NMR; DFT	MOLECULAR CALCULATIONS; BASIS-SETS; DENSITY; RUTHENIUM; BINDING; ATOMS; DNA	The synthesis, characterization and dynamic behavior of three complexes, cis-[Ru(bPY)(2)(NA)CI][PF6] (1), cis-[Ru(bPY)(2)(NA)I][PF6] (2) and cis-[Ru(bpY)(2)(NA)(2)][PF6](2) (3), where bpy is 2,2'-bipyridine, NA is nicotinamide are reported. These were designed as potential photoactivated antibacterial agents. Their dynamic behavior in solution was explored using NMR to probe the presence of atropisomers. The data show that the NA ligand in the bis-NA complex 3 rotates freely at 298 K on the NMR timescale; however, NA rotation in the mono-Cl and mono-I complexes 1 and 2 is hindered at the same temperature. DFT calculations suggested that this hindered rotation is due to hydrogen bonding between the NA protons closest to the nitrogen of the pyridine ring and the halide ligand. Interestingly CI hinders rotation more than 1, which corresponds to hydrogen bonding ability. Such dynamic behavior may influence the recognition of polypyridyl ruthenium drugs by biological targets.

J	Molina, A; Guerrero, J; Gomez, I; Merino, M				Molina, Alberto; Guerrero, Jaime; Gomez, Isabel; Merino, Manuel			A new multisensor software architecture for movement detection: Preliminary study with people with cerebral palsy	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN-COMPUTER STUDIES			English	Article						Cerebral palsy; Accelerometer; Flex sensor; Switch; Adaptive classifier	GAIT ANALYSIS; FLEX SENSORS; CHILDREN; SYSTEM	A five-layered software architecture translating movements into mouse clicks has been developed and tested on an Arduino platform with two different sensors: accelerometer and flex sensor. The architecture comprises low-pass and derivative filters, an unsupervised classifier that adapts continuously to the strength of the user's movements and a finite state machine which sets up a timer to prevent involuntary movements from triggering false positives. Four people without disabilities and four people with cerebral palsy (CP) took part in the experiments. People without disabilities obtained an average of 100% and 99.3% in precision and true positive rate (TPR) respectively and there were no statistically significant differences among type of sensors and placement. In the same experiment, people with disabilities obtained 97.9% and 100% in precision and TPR respectively. However, these results worsened when subjects used the system to access a communication board, 89.6% and 94.8% respectively. With their usual method of access-an adapted switch- they obtained a precision and TPR of 86.7% and 97.8% respectively. For 3-out-of-4 participants with disabilities our system detected the movement faster than the switch. For subjects with CP, the accelerometer was the easiest to use because it is more sensitive to gross motor motion than the flex sensor which requires more complex movements. A final survey showed that 3-out-of-4 participants with disabilities would prefer to use this new technology instead of their traditional method of access. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A hyperelastic-thermoviscoplastic constitutive model for semi-crystalline polymers: Application to PEEK under dynamic loading conditions	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLASTICITY			English	Article						Semi-crystalline polymers; High strain rate; Temperature dependence; Large deformation; PEEK	AMORPHOUS GLASSY-POLYMERS; STRAIN-RATE SENSITIVITY; LARGE-DEFORMATION; THERMOMECHANICAL BEHAVIOR; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; RUBBER ELASTICITY; DUCTILE RINGS; TEMPERATURE; COMPOSITES; STRESS	In this work, a hyperelastic-thermoviscoplastic constitutive model including thermomechanical coupling is presented to predict the mechanical behavior of semi-crystalline polymers. The constitutive model is based on the original approach developed by Polanco-Loria and coauthors (2010) and it accounts for: material hardening due to strain rate sensitivity, temperature evolution during the deformation process due to heat generation induced by plastic dissipation, thermal softening and thermal expansion of the material. The parameters of the constitutive model have been identified for polyether-ether-ketone (PEEK) from experimental data published by Rae and coauthors (2007). In order to analyze the predictive capacity of the model under dynamic conditions, the constitutive model has been implemented in a FE code within a large deformation framework to study two different problems: low velocity impact test on PEEK thin plates and dynamic necking on PEEK slender bar. These problems involve large and irreversible deformations, high strain rates and temperature increment due to plastic dissipation. The analysis determines the interplay between strain rate and thermal effects in the material behavior. The constitutive model presented herein reproduces adequately the mechanical behavior of PEEK under different thermal and loading conditions, demonstrating the importance of considering the coupling between temperature and strain rate.

The radial part depends on the analytical form of the potential, but the angular part does not. In this article, we first calculate the angular entropy of any central potential by means of two analytical procedures. Then, we explicitly find the dominant term of the radial entropy for the highly energetic (i.e., Rydberg) stationary states of the oscillator-like systems. The angular and radial contributions to these entropic measures are analytically expressed in terms of the quantum numbers which characterize the corresponding quantum states and, for the radial part, the oscillator strength. In the latter case, we use some recent powerful results of the information theory of the Laguerre polynomials and spherical harmonics which control the oscillator-like wavefunctions.

Yet to date, sustainability initiatives have been tackled primarily by means of conventional managerial approaches. We contend that these approaches are ill-suited for achieving sustainability transformations. We propose an alternative approach founded upon the sociological concept of robust action. In robust action, leaders embrace ambiguity (rather than striving for clarity), focus on short-term accomplishments (rather than long-term goals), and are satisfied with oblique movement (rather than linear progress). We elaborate on three robust strategies-participatory architecture, multivocal inscription and distributed experimentation and investigate their effectiveness in three sustainability related contexts: wind power, sustainability reporting and microcredit. We conclude by discussing the applicability of robust action to other contexts, and the complementarities between robust action and other forms of leadership towards sustainability.

An increasing global population, an evolution in consumers' needs, and changes in consumption models pose serious challenges to the overall sustainability of food production and consumption. Life cycle thinking (LCT) and assessment (LCA) are key elements in identifying more sustainable solutions for global food challenges. In defining solutions to major global challenges, it is fundamentally important to avoid burden shifting amongst supply chain stages and amongst typologies of impacts, and LCA should, therefore, be regarded as a reference method for the assessment of agri-food supply chains. Hence, this special volume has been prepared to present the role of life cycle thinking and life cycle assessment in: i) the identification of hotspots of impacts along food supply chains with a focus on major global challenges; ii) food supply chain optimisation (e.g. productivity increase, food loss reduction, etc.) that delivers sustainable solutions; and iii) assessment of future scenarios arising from both technological improvements and behavioural changes, and under different environmental conditions (e.g. climate change). This special volume consists of a collection of papers from a conference organized within the last Universal Exposition (EXP02015) "LCA for Feeding the planet and energy for life" in Milan (Italy) in 2015 as well as other contributions that were submitted in the year after the conference that addressed the same key challenges presented at the conference. The "papers in the special volume address some of the key challenges for optimizing food-related supply chains by using LCA as a reference method for environmental impact assessment. Beyond specific methodological improvements to better tailor LCA studies to food systems, there is a clear need for the LCA community to "think outside the box", exploring complementarity with other methods and domains. The concepts and the case studies presented in this special volume demonstrate how cross-fertilization among difference science domains (such as environmental, technological, social and economic ones) may be key elements of a sustainable "today and tomorrow" for feeding the planet.

As food production systems and consumption patterns are among the leading drivers of impacts on the environment, it is important to assess and improve food related supply chains as much as possible. Over the years, life cycle assessment has been used extensively to assess agricultural systems and food processing and manufacturing activities, and compare alternatives "from field to fork" and through to food waste management. Notwithstanding the efforts, several methodological aspects of life cycle assessment still need further improvement in order to ensure adequate and robust support for decision making in both business and policy development contexts. This paper discbsses the challenges for life cycle assessment arising from the complexity of food systems, and recommends research priorities for both scientific development and improvements in practical implementation. In summary, the intrinsic variability of food production systems requires dedicated modelling approaches, including addressing issues related to: the distinction between technosphere and ecosphere; the most appropriate functional unit; the multi-functionality of biological systems; and the modelling of the emissions and how this links with life cycle impact assessment. Also, data availability and interpretation of the results are two issues requiring further attention, including how to account for consumer behaviour. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Soil quality, properties, and functions in life cycle assessment: an evaluation of models	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Life cycle assessment; Land use; Soil quality; Soil functions; Midpoint indicators	USE IMPACT ASSESSMENT; LAND-USE IMPACTS; BIODIVERSITY; LCA; SUSTAINABILITY; INDICATOR; RESOURCE; ENERGY; CHAINS; SCALE	Soils provide essential ecosystem services for supporting both human and ecosystem needs and has been under pressures resulting from the intensification and expansion of human activities. In the last 15 years, substantial efforts have been made to quantify the impacts on soils derived from production systems and their related supply chains. In this study, a systematic, qualitative evaluation of up-to-date models connecting land occupation and land transformation to soil impact indicators (e.g., soil properties, functions, and threats) is performed. The focus is on models that may be applied for assessing supply chains, namely in the context of life cycle assessment (LCA). A range of eleven soil-related models was selected and evaluated against different criteria, including scientific soundness, stakeholders' acceptance, reproducibility, and the applicability of models from the perspective of LCA practitioners. Additionally, this study proposes a new land use cause-effect chain to qualify the impacts of land use on soils. None of the models is fulfilling all the criteria and includes comprehensively the cause-effect impact pathways. Notably, trade-offs were most frequent between the relevance of the modeled impact processes and the models' applicability. On the one hand, models proposing multi-indicators cover several drivers of impacts and have a broader scope. On the other hand, several models just focus on one driver of impact, but may provide more relevant impact characterization. Our results provide common ground for the development and identification of models that provide a comprehensive and robust assessment of land use change and land use impacts on soils. Indeed, to ensure both a comprehensive and relevant characterization of impacts, the study identifies several research needs for further models' developments, namely: 1) adopting a common land use cause-effect chain and land use classification; 2) accounting for different land management and land use intensities; 3) expanding the inventory data beyond the accounting of the area related to a certain land use; 4) assessing the added value of multi-indicators compared to single indicators, including the reduction of possible redundancies in the impact evaluation; 5) improving consistency from midpoint to endpoint characterization, especially the link with biodiversity; 6) guiding the calculation of normalization factors; and 7) assessing systematically model's uncertainty.

A panel data analysis across EU regions	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Energy; European agriculture; Fertilisers; Pesticides.; Productivity; Sustainability accounting	AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS; RESOURCE; SUSTAINABILITY; PERSPECTIVE; INDICATORS; NITROGEN; IMPACTS; FARMS	This paper addresses the need of finding new ways of measuring the environmental and economic consequences of farming. The aim of this study is to inquire into the impacts that excessive intensification has on productivity and environmental costs in the long term and additionally, to explore empirically the trend of these two indicators over time. The contribution of this paper is to perform an empirical study of the trends of productivity and environmental costs of farming in the long-term. To this end, this paper performs a panel data analysis of productivity and environmental costs on a farm accounting database across European regions over the 1989-2009 period. The models proposed take (i) farm output per hectare as indicator of productivity, and (ii) expenditures on energy, pesticides and fertilisers per hectare as proxy indicators of environmental costs. Results provide empirical evidence that the regions under study have a negative trend of productivity and a positive trend of environmental costs over the time frame mentioned. These results correlate negatively with both, economic and environmental sustainability of farms. Arguably, this is aggravated in the latter due to hidden environmental costs valued at zero in traditional accounting. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

To tackle this problem, in this article we present a novel systematic method for agriculture planning that optimally allocates rainfed and irrigated cropping areas, thereby enhancing food availability and reducing the environmental impact of agriculture. The allocation problem is mathematically formulated as a multi-objective linear programming problem that simultaneously accounts for the maximisation of the crop production and the minimisation of the environmental impact caused by water consumption. To quantify the environmental damage, life cycle assessment principles and water footprint concepts are integrated into the model. The capabilities of our tool are illustrated through its application to a real case study that considers wheat production in Spain. The results show that the current allocation of rainfed and irrigated wheat areas in Spain is sub-optimal. Our tool provides a set of alternatives for optimally reallocating these wheat areas that ultimately achieve significant reductions in environmental impact while maintaining or even increasing the production level. The analysis clearly demonstrates that the optimal allocation of rainfed and irrigated cropping areas is a potential pathway to minimise the environmental impact of water consumption in food production. Our systematic decision-support tool aims to assist famers and policy-makers in the transition towards a more sustainable agricultural sector. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Although the highest rice producers are Asian countries, this crop is also cultivated in Europe and, within Europe, Italy is the most relevant country. There are not studies evaluating in detail the environmental load arising from the application of urban sewage sludge in rice fields that, being flooded, are characterized by anaerobic conditions. The goal of this study was to evaluate the environmental performance of rice cultivation fertilised with urban sewage sludge in the Pavia district. Moreover, three mitigation strategies have been proposed and evaluated: the substitution of urban sewage sludge with compost, the introduction of an additional aeration and the collection of straw. The results suggest that the main contributors to the environmental impact of rice are methane emissions associated with the degradation of the organic matter during the flooding period, nitrogen emissions associated with the application of fertilisers, and diesel used for the field operations. The differences among the proposed alternative scenarios are considerable, suggesting that strategies to improve the environmental performance of rice are possible. In more details, in order to reduce the environmental burdens of rice fertilised with urban sewage sludge, the two most effective possibilities are: the substitution of urban sewage sludge with compost and the implementation of an additional aeration period during the cultivation. The first option determines an improvement in all the categories analysed, and particularly in toxicity-related impact categories, with reductions of 99.6%, 78.8% and 68.7% for human toxicity-cancer effects, human toxicity-non cancer effects and freshwater ecotoxicity, respectively, followed by Climate Change (-25.4%) and Mineral Fossil Resource Depletion (-19.2%). The introduction of an additional aeration is beneficial for the Climate Change and Photochemical Oxidant Formation, with a reduction of 9.7% and 1.6%, respectively. Concerning the results of the Climate Change impact category, the use of standard emission factors for the estimation of methane emission involves uncertainty; the development of country-specific emission factors would be instrumental in overcoming this point of weakness. Finally, despite the focus on the Italian context, this study proposes different mitigation strategies, which can be applied to other rice systems in order to reduce their environmental impact.

This wastage has disposal problems due to its phytotoxicity and high moisture content, so strategies for its use and revalorization are needed. One of these strategies is the extraction of bioactive compounds, as is the case of polyphenols present in the waste, which could be used as natural antioxidants in food. This study evaluated the effect of adding an olive waste extract (100, 200 or 400 mg gallic acid equivalents/kg muscle), as a possible natural polyphenol-rich antioxidant on the stability of lamb meat patties enriched with omega-3 fatty acids, and stored in high-oxygen modified atmosphere packs for up to 9 days at 4 degrees C. Addition of the extract delayed meat discolouration, lipid oxidation (p <= 0.001) and protein carbonylation (p <= 0.001), and increased loss of thiol groups (p <= 0.05) relative to controls. Fish odour (p <= 0.01) and flavour (p <= 0.05) were lower and odd odour and flavour (p <= 0.001) higher in patties with added the extract compared to controls, but the overall liking score was not affected. The addition of the extract resulted in acceptable lamb meat patties (in terms of oxidation) after 6 days of storage, while patties without extract did not. The results pointed out the potential for using olive waste extracts as natural antioxidants in meat products. With this strategy, the olive oil industry would encourage to follow an eco-friendlier olive oil production chain obtaining marketable products from the wastes generated. At the same time, the shelf life (in terms of oxidation process) of the lamb patties would be increased reducing food wastes at the point-of-sale and at consumer level, which is especially important in a high perishable food such as minced meat products, and reducing the environmental impact that food waste causes along the food supply chain.

This paper evaluates the implications of levying consumption taxes on food products in Spain based on their carbon footprint. Specific elasticities are estimated for the food demand system based on a dataset of around 20,000 households, using a demand system model. The results show that this policy can reduce emissions and, at the same time, help to change consumption patterns towards healthier diets. For the first time in the related literature, this paper also explores the distributional implications. The results show that carbon based food taxation tends to be slightly regressive and can have more effect on specific social groups. However, that effect can be ameliorated if exemptions on some basic food products are introduced. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Firstly, the environmental impacts considered in the assessment method developed by the Leiden University (CML 2001) are analyzed for each case, demonstrating the influence of the wall height and permissible soil stress. Secondly, this paper evaluates the contribution range of each element to each impact. The elements considered are: concrete, landfill, machinery, formwork, steel, and transport. Moreover, the influence of the wall height on the contribution of each element over the total impact is studied. This paper then provides the impact factors per unit of concrete, steel, and formwork. These values enable designers to quickly evaluate impacts from available measurements. Finally, the influence of steel recycling on the environmental impacts is highlighted. Findings indicate that concrete is the biggest contributor to all impact categories, especially the global warming potential.

Development of the life cycle inventory of masonry mortar made of natural and recycled aggregates	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Construction and demolition waste; Life cycle inventory; Life cycle assessment; Masonry mortar; Recycled aggregate	ENVIRONMENTAL-IMPACT ASSESSMENT; BUILDING-MATERIALS; CONVENTIONAL CONCRETE; CONSTRUCTION; LCA; WASTE; PRODUCTS; ROAD	The use of recycled fine aggregate from construction and demolition waste as a replacement for natural fine aggregate in the manufacture of masonry mortar represents an environmental benefit that must be quantified. The life cycle assessment is a procedure that allows to know the environmental impacts associated with a product throughout its life cycle; for that purpose, it incorporates a series of phases of which inventory analysis is one of the most important as it directly influences its overall quality. The main aim of this study has been to develop the life cycle inventory of masonry mortars made of natural fine aggregate and recycled fine aggregate in accordance with ISO 14040 and ISO 14044, and being the system subject of study from cradle to gate level, thus boundaries included the production of the mortar components (natural fine aggregate, recycled fine aggregate, filler, cement and additive) and the production of masonry mortar in mortar plant. For the inventory development, production data given by the producers, Ecoinvent v.2.2 database and Environmental Product Declaration were used as data source. According to the results obtained, thanks to this study the main inputs regarding energy and raw material consumption and the main outputs (products, coproducts, waste and emissions) have been identified and quantified, linked to the masonry mortar life cycle and found inside the system boundaries considered. In a future research, the inventory developed shall allow to assess and compare the environmental impacts related to the production of masonry mortars made of natural fine aggregate and recycled fine aggregate.

Desalination of shale gas produced water: A rigorous design approach for zero-liquid discharge evaporation systems	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Shale gas; Zero-liquid discharge (ZLD); Single-effect evaporation (SEE); Multiple-effect evaporation (MEE); Mechanical vapor recompression (MVR); Energy recovery	MECHANICAL VAPOR COMPRESSION; FALLING FILM EVAPORATION; MICROFILTRATION MEMBRANES; FLOWBACK; TUBE	Shale gas has recently emerged as a promising energy source to face the increasing global demand. This paper introduces a new rigorous optimization model for the simultaneous synthesis of single and multiple-effect evaporation (SEE/MEE) systems, considering mechanical vapor recompression (MVR) and energy recovery. The proposed model has been especially developed for the desalination of high-salinity produced water from shale gas hydraulic fracturing ("fracking"). Its main objective is to enhance the system energy efficiency through the reduction of brine discharges. Therefore, the outflow brine salinity should be near to salt saturation conditions to achieve zero liquid discharge (ZLD). The multiple-effect superstructure is comprised by several effects of horizontal-tube falling film evaporation. Due to the inclusion of the electric-driven mechanical compressor, no other external energy source is needed in the SEE/MEE system. A more accurate process design is attained through the calculation of the overall heat transfer coefficients in function of the individual coefficients for the falling boiling film and vapor condensation. Additionally, the SEE/MEE-MVR model allows the estimation of the major geometrical characteristics of the evaporation system. The non-linear programming (NLP)-based model is optimized using the CONOPT solver under GAMS by the minimization of the process total annualized cost. Thermal analysis is carried out to evaluate the effects of the feed salinity and geometrical parameters on system heat transfer performance. The results highlight the ability of the developed model to rigorously design SEE/MEE-MVR systems by improving their cost-effectively and reaching ZLD conditions. (C) 2016 The Authors.

In this exploratory work, a model of environmental practices adoption and its impact on independent hotels is developed. Two different destinations are proposed and analysed: the mature market of Madrid in Spain and the emerging destinations of Santiago and Valparaiso in Chile. To test the model, a qualitative method based on case studies of 24 hotels-12 hotels for each country-was used. The findings show that environmental practices are implemented in both destinations and demonstrate the diverse impacts of this implementation, primarily in the financial and operational spheres. Differences are observed in the two countries regarding the proposed model, mainly in terms of barriers to implementing environmental practices, products used and processes related to clients and suppliers' responsibility. Therefore, this research implies that the hotels analysed are adopting an environmental management approach, although in different ways. The added value of this research is that it sheds light on the vision of sustainability in emerging and mature destinations and offers practical suggestions for hotel management regarding the implementation of various environmental practices and new environmental practices in hotel management.

Cleaner quality control system using bioimpedance methods: a review for fruits and vegetables	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Review						Fruits; Vegetables; Bioimpedance; Quality; Clean control	ELECTRICAL-IMPEDANCE ANALYSIS; DIELECTRIC-PROPERTIES; PLANT-TISSUES; SPECTROSCOPY; PRODUCTS; FOOD; MEMBRANES; BEHAVIOR; INJURY; SENSOR	Due to the very rapid development of technology as well as the increased demand of quality food, vegetables and fruits are more under spotlights for enhancing their healthy characteristics. With the involvement of new mathematical methods and updated variety of scientific investigations in food science, the need for better characterization of agricultural products arises. This review covers the bioimpedance method used for electrical characterization of fruits and vegetables, known as the bioimpedance spectroscopy. This electrical advantageous method offers an ecological agricultural production. By evaluating the quality factors of horticultural products, bioimpedance targets a double sustainable plan: an environmental friendly food control and an improved consumer's health care at once. An objective interpretation of the quality factors importance in the horticultural sector is presented along with a wide definition of bioimpedance spectroscopy. Moreover, the paper highlights techniques used for the bioimpedance properties measurements since their initiations. The collective data is tabulated for the destructive, non-destructive bioimpedance where clear objectives and focused conclusions of each measurement method are displayed. This paper summarizes the various findings and conclusions of these experiments seeking better oriented investigation in the future and encouraging further quality food applications in areas where data is still ambiguous. Non-destructive bioimpedance techniques open new perspectives for cleaner quality control system in industrial applications for fruit and vegetables quality determination. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Pattern of distribution of serotonergic fibers to the amygdala and extended amygdala in the rat	JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE NEUROLOGY			English	Article						fear; anxiety; stress; basolateral complex of amygdala; central nucleus of amygdala; pallial amygdala; subpallial amygdala; bed nucleus of stria terminalis; 5-HT1A receptors; 5-HT2C receptors	DORSAL RAPHE NUCLEUS; CORTICOTROPIN-RELEASING HORMONE; ELEVATED T-MAZE; STRIA TERMINALIS; BED NUCLEUS; BASOLATERAL AMYGDALA; 5-HT1A RECEPTORS; CONDITIONED FEAR; MONOAMINERGIC INNERVATION; ASCENDING PROJECTIONS	As is well recognized, serotonergic (5-HT) fibers distribute widely throughout the forebrain, including the amygdala. Although a few reports have examined the 5-HT innervation of select nuclei of the amygdala in the rat, no previous report has described overall 5-HT projections to the amygdala in the rat. Using immunostaining for the serotonin transporter, SERT, we describe the complete pattern of distribution of 5-HT fibers to the amygdala (proper) and to the extended amygdala in the rat. Based on its ontogenetic origins, the amygdala was subdivided into two major parts, pallial and subpallial components, with the pallial component further divided into superficial and deep nuclei (Olucha-Bordonau et al. 2015). SERT+ fibers were shown to distributed moderately to densely to the deep and cortical pallial nuclei, but, by contrast, lightly to the subpallial nuclei. Specifically, 1) of the deep pallial nuclei, the lateral, basolateral, and basomedial nuclei contained a very dense concentration of 5-HT fibers; 2) of the cortical pallial nuclei, the anterior cortical and amygdala-cortical transition zone rostrally and the posteromedial and posterolateral nuclei caudally contained a moderate concentration of 5-HT fibers; and 3) of the subpallial nuclei, the anterior nuclei and the rostral part of the medial (Me) nuclei contained a moderate concentration of 5-HT fibers, whereas caudal regions of Me as well as the central nuclei and the intercalated nuclei contained a sparse/light concentration of 5-HT fibers. With regard to the extended amygdala (primarily the bed nucleus of stria terminalis; BST), on the whole, the BST contained moderate numbers of 5-HT fibers, spread fairly uniformly throughout BST. The findings are discussed with respect to a critical serotonergic influence on the amygdala, particularly on the basal complex, and on the extended amygdala in the control of states of fear and anxiety.

The irreversible capacity of the negative electrode in the full cell configuration is compensated by the addition of a sacrificial salt such as NaN3 to the P2Na0.67[Fe0.5Mn0.5]O-2 cathode material. 60% increase in the reversible capacity is achieved with the addition of 10% of sodium azide in the composite cathode without compromise on the cycle life. Though, there is a limit in its use because of the capacity fade which can be observed with the further increase in NaN3 content. The quantification of sodium ions at the end of discharge (at 1 V) after 40 cycles by ex-situ X-ray diffraction and solid state nuclear magnetic resonance supports the electrochemical data. Scanning electron microscopy shows the effect of NaN3 on the electrode microstructure in terms of the porosity created by NaN3 decomposition. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Recently, it has been used for heavy metals removal like copper, due to the presence of amino and hydroxyl groups in its structure. Chitosan membranes were crosslinked with epichlorohydrin and bisoxirano and functionalized with chelating agents, such as iminodiacetic acid, aspartic acid and tris-(2-amino-ethyl) polyamine. These membranes were used for copper adsorption and the formed complexes were characterized. Thermal and crystalline properties of chitosan membranes were studied by TG-DCS and X-ray diffraction. Raman, XPS and FT-IR data confirmed that copper is linked to the modified chitosan membranes by the amino groups. The oxidation state of copper-chitosan membranes were also studied by angle resolved XPS, and by UV Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The optical, structure, morphology and electrochemical properties of these films were studied by UV-vis ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), cyclic voltammetry(CV) and chronoamperometry traces (CA), respectively. The measurements reveal that SPS has more stability, excellent reversibility, and homogeneity during cycling than EDS. The coloration efficiency (eta) of SPS was 124.3 cm(2)/C while it was 47 cm(2)/C for EDS prepared from the same precursor materials and on the same substrate. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH.

By use of active control and adaptive control method, efficient hybrid control strategies are designed for FO T-S fuzzy neural networks with time-delay and uncertain parameters. Based on the new version of FO Lyapunov stability theory, the projective synchronization conditions are addressed in terms of linear matrix inequalities, which is easy for checking and applying in practical systems. Finally, numerical simulations have shown to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and the application of the proposed method to secure communications have presented to validate the synchronization method.

FTU Team	Runaway electron generation and control	PLASMA PHYSICS AND CONTROLLED FUSION			English	Article						tokamak; runaway electrons; synchrotron radiation	FRASCATI TOKAMAK UPGRADE; FTU; ARCHITECTURE; DESIGN; SYSTEM; MARTE	We present an overview of FTU experiments on runaway electron (RE) generation and control carried out through a comprehensive set of real-time (RT) diagnostics/control systems and newly installed RE diagnostics. An RE imaging spectrometer system detects visible and infrared synchrotron radiation. A Cherenkov probe measures RE escaping the plasma. A gamma camera provides hard x-ray radial profiles from RE bremsstrahlung interactions in the plasma. Experiments on the onset and suppression of RE show that the threshold electric field for RE generation is larger than that expected according to a purely collisional theory, but consistent with an increase due to synchrotron radiation losses. This might imply a lower density to be targeted with massive gas injection for RE suppression in ITER. Experiments on active control of disruption-generated RE have been performed through feedback on poloidal coils by implementing an RT boundary-reconstruction algorithm evaluated on magnetic moments. The results indicate that the slow plasma current ramp-down and the simultaneous reduction of the reference plasma external radius are beneficial in dissipating the RE beam energy and population, leading to reduced RE interactions with plasma facing components. RE active control is therefore suggested as a possible alternative or complementary technique to massive gas injection.

The method combines three different aspects of particular relevance in portable machines: a process force and machine stiffness model, a geometric error model and a machine and work piece inter-referencing error model. The combination of these models helps to control and define the effects of different errors in the virtual mobile machine, before a real prototype is built. An application to a particular portable machine is presented where error values are either simulated or experimentally obtained from a conventional three-axis milling machine where typical strategies of mobile machines are implemented and tested. The research shows that portable machines can be a solution for automatic and unattended machining operations with accuracy requirements below 0.1 mm. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Physical properties of biaxially oriented poly(ethylene terephtalate) irradiated at different temperatures and doses with electron beam	RADIATION PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Poly(ethylene terephtalate); Electron beam irradiation; Thermal properties; Tensile properties	POLYETHYLENE TEREPHTHALATE; GAMMA-IRRADIATION; RADIATION	The electron beam irradiation of a biaxially oriented PET film was carried out in air over a range of 50-3000 kGy at different temperatures and a dose rate of 4.48 kGy min(-1). The effects of the irradiation at temperatures above and below the glass transition temperature (Tg) on the thermal and mechanical properties were studied. Melting temperature decreased slightly and crystallization temperature and crystallinity increased significantly with the increase in dose, more at higher irradiation temperature, whereas Tg did not show any significant change with dose or temperature. Mechanical properties were adversely affected by.irradiation. Stress and strain at break were strongly reduced, more at higher irradiation temperature, and Young's Modulus slightly increased with the increase in dose. The changes in properties were related to the chain scission produced by the electron beam irradiation leading to a decrease in molecular weight. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The UV-IR CL emission consists of (i) a UV waveband in the range of 340-420 nm,(ii) blue band at 450-480 nm and (iii) a broad emission in the green-red region (at 550-650 nm) that could be respectively linked to Non Bridging Oxygen Hole Centers (equivalent to Si-O center dot), self-trapped excitons and point defects (Mn2+ -0.03%- and Fe -1.15%-). Thermal treatments performed on the TL glow curves allowed us to determine that the trap system could be associated with a continuum in the trap distribution, since successive thermal pretreatments in the range of 200-310 degrees C induce an emission that shifts linearly to higher temperatures when the thermal pretreatment (T-stop) is increased, while the intensity of the maxima decreases similarly to the peak area. The evaluation of the Ea values, s value and the trap system calculated by VHR, IR and Glow curve fitting methods considering three possible distribution function for n(E): gaussian, exponential and uniform, has given matching values for the 280 degrees C TL peak.

Non-destructive micro-analytical system for the study of the manufacturing processes of a group of gold jewels from "El Carambolo" treasure	RADIATION PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Portable micro-XRF; Gold jewelry; Soldering; El Carambolo; Tartesic	PIXE; SPECTROMETER	The impressive gold treasure of El Carambolo, representative of the Tartesic culture and dated from the 8th to 6th century BCE, constitutes a typological and stylistic unity unparalleled in the archeological field. Due to the importance of this treasure and the interest in studying it in depth, a new micro X-ray fluorescence (micro-XRF) portable system has been developed at the Centro Nacional de Aceleradores (Sevilla, Spain). Eleven jewels of El Carambolo treasure have been analyzed in order to characterize the composition of the employed alloys, to identify the manufacturing processes and to discuss hypothesis about the production workshop of the treasure. Besides, the application of the new micro-XRF instrumentation allowed the analysis of small details like decoration elements and joining areas. This study permits the characterization of the joining methods and manufacturing procedures, thus, the construction stages of these highly complex jewels can be inferred. Many archeological and historical studies of the treasure have been performed during the last years but very few analytical results have been published. Furthermore, the results demonstrate the capability of the new developed portable micro-XRF setup to substitute satisfactorily other micro-analytical techniques, such as micro-PIXE (Particle Induced X-ray Emission), when the sample cannot be brought to a laboratory.

Cathodoluminescence emission of REE (Dy, Pr and Eu) doped LaAlO3 phosphors	RADIATION PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Cathodoluminescence; LaAlO3; Sol-gel method; Rare-earth elements	LANTHANUM ALUMINATE; LUMINESCENCE; GLASSES; FILMS; PHOTOLUMINESCENCE; TRANSITION; PRECURSORS	Luminescence emission from rare earth (REE) ions doped materials are being of interest since can be employed as scintillators, catalysts, battery and magnetic materials, etc. We herein report on the preliminary results obtained from the cathodoluminescence (CL) properties of undoped LaAlO3 (LAO) and LaAlO3: REE3+ (REE=Dy3+, Pr+ and Eu3+) samples synthesized by a sol-gel process based on the Pechini's method with a spray-drying technique. The samples, previously characterized by means of Environmental Scanning Electron Microscopy and Energy Dispersive X-Ray Analysis Spectrometry, display CL spectra with well-defined peaks that could specifically be associated with the LAO structure (in the range of 300-450 nm) and point defects (from 450 to 800 nm) spectral regions. The observed wavebands are as follows: (i) 480 and 570 from the Dy-doped LAO correspond respectively to F-4(9/2)-> 6H(15/2) and F-4(9/2)-> 6H(13/2) transitions, (ii) 490-638 from the Pr-doped LAO is linked to P-3(0)-> H-3(4), D-1(2)-> H-3(4) transitions and (iii) 590 and 620 where the dopant Eu3+ gives rise to (D0 -> F1)-D-5-F-7 and D-5(0)-> F-7(2) transitions and (iv) a UV-blue broad band is associated with NBHOC in undoped LAO. Such emissions are due to the presence of the 4f electrons of rare earth ions that are shielded by the outer 5s and 5p electrons, the intra-4f emission spectra of REE that induce sharp and narrow wavebands.

As a case study, we consider the transport of protons with the initial energy of 1 MeV until their thermalization, so that we cover the energy range that contributes mainly to the energy deposition in the Bragg peak region. In order to include protons into the simulation procedure, a comprehensive dataset of integral and differential cross sections of elastic and inelastic scattering of intermediate- and low-energy protons from water molecules is created.

In recent years, fuel cells have been applied in the medical field in both exploratory research and prospective products, as they offer multiple advantages over conventional batteries, including ease of recharging, environmentally friendly character and high security. In this paper, we summarize the up to date progress of this energy system in implantable medical devices which use microorganisms, enzymes and precious metals as catalysts, respectively. Safety is the most concerned issue in this application. In addition, we introduce a variety of applications of fuel cells on the vitro medical equipments (such as blood glucose meter, alcohol tester, wound treatment instrument). The introduction of fuel cells on implementable medical devices is in early stage of research, nonetheless the prospects/potential of this application are grant. Evidently, mankind could come across a new medical revolution upon the successful introduction of fuel cells to the human body. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

From plants to architecture: Biomimetic principles for the development of adaptive architectural envelopes	RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS			English	Review						Biomimicry; Adaptive architectural envelopes; Energy efficiency; Plant adaptations; Climate adaptations	BUILDING ENVELOPE; ENERGY-EFFICIENT; SYSTEMS; LESSONS; STORAGE; DESIGN	Facades have an important role in the control of energy waste in buildings, nevertheless most of them are designed to provide static design solutions, wasting large amounts of energy to maintain the internal comfort. However, biological adaptation solutions are complex, multi-functional and highly responsive. This paper proposes a biomimetic research of the relationship that can be developed between Biology and Architecture in order to propose innovative fa cade design solutions. We focus on plants, because of plants, like buildings, lack of movement and remain subject to a specific location. Nevertheless, plants have adapted to the environment developing special means of interaction with changing external issues. This paper provides a methodology to create a data collection of plant adaptations and a design mapping to guide the transfer from biological principles to architectural resources, as well as two design concept cases, opening new perspectives for new possible technical solutions and showing the potential of plant adaptations to environmental conditions at a specific climate. Further step is the transformation of some design concepts into technical solutions through experiments with new technologies that include multi-material 3D printing or advances in material science.

A review of contemporary work and recommendations for future developments	RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS			English	Review						Energy; Water; Nexus; Integrated planning	ELECTRICITY-GENERATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; MIDDLE-EAST; FOOD NEXUS; SYSTEMS; OPTIMIZATION; MANAGEMENT; OPERATION; MARKET; POWER	Availability of and access to water and energy are key ingredients for economic and social development. Unfortunately, more than a billion people still lack access to both safe freshwater and basic energy services. Future predictions show that the situation may become worse with about a 40% increase in energy demand and 30% increase in water demand by 2040. In addition, water and energy are highly interdependent, with water needed in all phases of the energy lifecycle and energy needed in all phases of the water lifecycle. While recent years have seen an increasing number of studies on the water-energy nexus, the research is focused on scattered individual areas of the nexus, each important in their own right. However, there is now a need to synthesize these efforts and identify the most important elements needed for a holistic water-energy nexus methodology. This paper focuses on the benefits to be gained from and the drawbacks of ignoring various water-energy interlinks for policy makers and planners in their goals to meet long term resource security. Several possible combinations of socio-economic and climate change scenarios make these goals even more challenging. The lessons learnt from reviewing different integration methodologies and studies are compiled into a list of key recommendations. It is found that current integration efforts are often biased towards the energy sector and its water requirements. There is still a need for better representations of the water infrastructure and corresponding linkages with the energy sector. There is also a need to harmonize the energy and water systems from both a technical and policy perspective. This calls for compatible disaggregation of spatial and temporal elements in both systems as well as designing model outputs to allow evaluation of the synergies and tradeoffs of multi-scale, cross-sector policies.

These increasingly strict regulations, together with the increase in natural gas consumption and its price, have conditioned propulsion systems implemented on board vessels. This article reviews the different propulsion systems used on board vessels for the transport of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG). The study describes the main characteristics of the propulsion systems, and the advantages and drawbacks that come along with these, from its very beginnings up to the systems installed to date. The described propulsion systems include both gas and steam turbines, combined cycles, 2 and 4 stroke internal combustion engines, as well as reliquefaction plants, while encompassing mechanical, electric and Dual Fuel (DF) technology systems. The propulsion systems implemented have undergone continual alteration in order to adjust to market needs, which were always governed by both efficiency and the possibility of consuming boil-off gas (BOG), always in compliance with the strict antipollution regulations in force. The current direction of LNG vessel propulsion systems is the installation of 2-stroke DF low pressure engines due to their high efficiency and their possibility of installing a BOG reliquefaction plant. Another great advantage of this propulsion system is its compliance with the IMO TIER III emission regulations, without the need to install any supplementary gas treatment system.

The example presented is from Europe, however, the barriers and conclusions are universal. It was shown that various waste materials such as glass, asphalt, concrete, wood, plastics etc. have a potential for re-use in asphalt roads. The available quantities of the European target waste materials that would otherwise be incinerated or disposed in landfills were considered. It was shown that there is high potential in Europe for recycling in road construction, in particular, under the hypothetical scenario where 33% of new roads would be made of the target waste materials (excluding RAP which is already recycled), it is estimated that 16% of the available waste quantities could be recycled in roads. Four hypothetical roads were analysed showing a considerable savings in costs, CO2 and energy in comparison to conventional asphalt mixtures using all virgin components. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Environmental impact of Recover cotton in textile industry	RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING			English	Article						Life cycle assessment; Cotton; Recover; Upcycled textile system; Organic; Conventional; Recycled	LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; LCA	A comparative evaluation of the life cycle assessment (LCA) of Recover cotton, obtained from recycled garments, and virgin one, cultivated from traditional and organic crops, has been made based on the quantification of environmental impact categories, such as abiotic depletion, global warming, water use, acidification and eutrophication potential. LCA data reported in the literature for the steps of cultivation, ginning/cutting, and dyeing were compared in order to clearly show the environmental advantages of moving from traditional practices, to organic cultivation and the use of Recover cotton, a novel procedure that involves the production of cotton yarns from coloured and well characterized recycled materials. Studies made evidenced that the use of organic cotton cultivation avoids the use of pesticides and chemicals, reducing environmental impacts, but maintaining those related to ginning and dyeing steps. However, the use of Recover cotton avoids the impact of both, cotton cultivation and dyeing steps, based on an appropriate selection of raw materials obtained from textile wastes, being only increased the energy costs of cutting/shredding processes as compared to ginning ones. In short, it can be concluded that the use of Recover cotton for the production of high quality textiles involves an added value of the products from an environmental point of view, being costs and electrical consumes also reduced and providing a second life for produced textiles.

J	Jimenez-Rivero, A; Garcia-Navarro, J				Jimenez-Rivero, Ana; Garcia-Navarro, Justo			Exploring factors influencing post-consumer gypsum recycling and landfilling in the European Union	RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING			English	Article						Gypsum waste; Plasterboard; Recycling market; Policy instruments; Circular economy; Urban mining	CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS; WASTE-MANAGEMENT; DEMOLITION WASTE; CONSTRUCTION-INDUSTRY; HONG-KONG; DECONSTRUCTION; CHINA; IMPEDIMENTS; PROJECTS	Post-consumer gypsum waste (GW) is increasingly generated in the European Union and not adequately managed in 20 out of the 28 European countries. Overall, it is estimated that 87% of post-consumer GW is landfilled in the EU-28. This waste stream holds unique characteristics, mainly due to its non inert nature and its high sulphate content. Two main undesirable effects are produced when gypsum is not managed appropriately. First, gypsum contaminates concrete for recycling when treated as mixed waste. Second, the disposal of GW at landfills poses a risk of higher landfill emissions. Overall, potential secondary resources are lost. The main objective of this study is to explore factors influencing gypsum recycling and landfilling in the EU-28. The method includes a study of the literature and a. structured questionnaire distributed to stakeholders. Data analysis is used to rank the critical factors (CFs) and conduct a comparison of respondents' views divided into two groups (gypsum recycling and non-gypsum recycling countries are differentiated). The results show a set of 15 CFs categorized into four domains: policy, economic, social and environmental. More than half of the CFs belong to the policy domain, which indicates the relevance of regulatory and economic instruments for promoting a circular economy for gypsum. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

A significant problem related to the study of soil water erosion in these areas consists in the lack of a standardized procedure of collecting data and reporting results, mainly due to a variability among the measurement methods applied. Given this issue and the seriousness of soil water erosion in Mediterranean vineyards, this works aims to quantify the soil losses caused by simulated rainstorms, and compare them with each other depending on two different methodologies: (i) rainfall simulation and (ii) surface elevation change-based, relying on high-resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) derived from a photogrammetric technique (Structure-from-Motion or SfM). The experiments were carried out in a typical Mediterranean vineyard, located in eastern Spain, at very fine scales. SfM data were obtained from one reflex camera and a smartphone built-in camera. An index of sediment connectivity was also applied to evaluate the potential effect of connectivity within the plots. DEMs derived from the smartphone and the reflex camera were comparable with each other in terms of accuracy and capability of estimating soil loss. Furthermore, soil loss estimated with the surface elevation change-based method resulted to be of the same order of magnitude of that one obtained with rainfall simulation, as long as the sediment connectivity within the plot was considered. High-resolution topography derived from SfUrevealed to be essential in the sediment connectivity analysis and, therefore, in the estimation of eroded materials, when comparing them to those derived from the rainfall simulation methodology.

We found that under continental (W-NW-N)and Etesian (NE) synoptic wind flow and with a deep moist PBL (similar to 2-2.5 km height), mixed hygroscopic (anthropogenic, biomass burning and marine) particles arrive over the GM, and contribute to the formation of convective non-precipitating PBL clouds (of similar to 16-20 mu m mean diameter) with vertical extent up to 500 m. Under these conditions, high updraft velocities (1-2 m s-1) and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentrations (similar to 2000 cm(-3) at 1% supersaturation), generated clouds with an estimated cloud droplet number of similar to 600 cm(-3). Under Saharan wind flow conditions (S-SW) a shallow PBL (<1-1.2 km height) develops, leading to much higher CCN concentrations (similar to 3500-5000 cm(-3) at 1% supersaturation) near the ground; updraft velocities, however, were significantly lower, with an estimated maximum cloud droplet number of similar to 200 cm(-3) and without observed significant PBL cloud formation. The largest contribution to cloud droplet number variance is attributed to the updraft velocity variability, followed by variances in aerosol number concentration. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Combined in situ effects of metals and nutrients on marine biofilms: Shifts in the diatom assemblage structure and biological traits	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Review						Multiple stressors; Diatom community composition; Growth form; Species succession; Coastal systems	INDUCED COMMUNITY TOLERANCE; ECOLOGICAL GUILDS; PERIPHYTON COMMUNITIES; COASTAL LAGOON; WATER-QUALITY; LIFE-FORMS; CASEY-STATION; MINING WASTES; IRGAROL 1051; POLLUTION	The effects of multiple stressors on marine diatom assemblages are still poorly understood. The interactive effects of metals and nutrients were assessed in two coastal biofilms grown at a reference site and a historically contaminated site. The biofilms were exposed in situ to pulse exposures of metals (Zn and Pb) and nutrients (N and P) individually and in combination to mimic patterns of discharge in the study area. The reference community's structure (composition and abundance of taxa) was modified after metals and/or nutrients exposure, but each stressor acted in different way. Irrespective of the stressors or scenario, the abundance of the dominant species Opephora krumbeinii declined, and it is proposed as sensitive species. Nutrient supply favoured the proliferation of certain species with high nutrient tolerances (Fragilaria famelica, Tabularia ktenoeides), whereas metals promoted the colonisation of metal-tolerant species, e.g., Berkeleya fennica, Opephora marina. Simultaneous exposure induced an amplification of levels of accumulated metals, chlorophyll a and EPS contents and triggered the succession of species towards tolerant species with specific growth. Metals seemed to act as a selective factor of metal-tolerant species, and nutrients favoured the proliferation of those species forming zig-zag colonies (Neosynedra provincial's), mucous tubes (Berkeleya spp.) and motile diatoms (Navicula salinicola, Nitzschia incognita), resulting in biofilms with a more complex architecture. The diatom communities from the historically contaminated site were more resistant to pulse exposure, but metals or nutrients loads induced overproduction of mucilage. We propose that growth forms may complement taxonomic approaches and provide a quick and easy way to detect community changes related to metal and nutrient pollution. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The VF had a surface area of 3144 m(2), and was divided into four wetland cells, out of which two were operated while the other two rested, alternating cycles of 30 days. The nitrifying and denitrifying bacterial communities were characterized in wetland cell 3 (764 m(2) surface area) over a period of 12 months by using the FISH technique. Samples were collected monthly (from Feb 2014 to Feb 2015) from different layers within the vertical profile, during operation and rest periods, comprising a total of 6 sampling campaigns while the cell was in operation and another 6 when the cell was at rest. This wetland cell operated with an average organic loading rate (OLR) of 4 g COD m(-2) d(-1) and a hydraulic loading rate of 24.5 mm d(-1). The rest periods of the wetland cell presented influences on the abundance of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) (8% and 3% for feed and rest periods, respectively), and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) (5% and 2% for feed and rest periods, respectively). However, there was no influence of the rest periods on the denitrifying bacteria. AOB were only identified in the top layer (AOB)beta-proteobacteria) in both operational and rest periods. On the other hand, the NOB (Nistrospirae and Nitrospina gracilis) were identified in feed periods just in the top layer and during rest periods just in the intermediate layer. The denitrifying bacteria (Pseudomonas spp. and Thiobacillus denitrificans) were identified from the intermediate layer downwards, and remained stable in both periods. Based on the identified bacterial dynamics, the partially saturated VF wetland operated under low OLR enabled favorable conditions for simultaneous nitrification and denitrification.

Examining diversity patterns across variable river conditions can help develop better management strategies. However, many indicators can be used to determine the conservartion value of aquatic communities, and little is known of how well they correlate to each other in making diagnostics, including when testing for the efficacy of protected areas. Using an extensive data set (99,700 km(2), n = 530 sites) across protected and unprotected river reaches in 15 catchments of NE Spain, we examine correlations among 20 indicators of conservation value of fish communities, including the benefits they provide to birds and threatened mammals and mussels. Our results showed that total native fish abundance or richness correlated reasonably well with many native indicators. However, the lack of a strong congruence led modelling techniques to identify different river attributes for each indicator of conservation-value. Overall, tributaries were identified as native fish refugees, and nutrient pollution, salinization, low water velocity and poor habitat structure as major threats to the native biota. We also found that protected areas offered limited coverage to major components of biodiversity, including rarity, threat and host-parasite relationships, even though values of non-native indicators were notably reduced. In conclusion, restoring natural hydrological regimes and water chemical status is a priority to stem freshwater biodiversity loss in this region. A complementary action can be the protection of tributaries, but more studies examining multiple components of diversity are necessary to fully test their potential as fluvial reserves in Mediterranean climate areas.

Recent proposed methods describing sub-daily flow fluctuations are focused on limited components of the flow regime being unable to fully represent it, or on the identification of peaking events based on subjectively defined thresholds, being unsuitable for evaluations of short-term flow regime alterations through comparisons between regulated and free-flowing rivers. This study aims to launch an innovative approach based on the visual display of quantitative information to address the challenge of the short-term hydrologic characterization and evaluation of alteration resulting from hydropeaking. We propose a graphical method to represent a discrete set of ecologically relevant indices that characterize and evaluate the alteration of sub-daily flow regimes. The frequency of occurrence of classified values of a descriptive hydrological variable is represented in a map-like graph where longitude, latitude and altitude represent the Julian day, the value of the variable and the frequency of occurrence, respectively. Subsequently, we tested the method on several rivers, both free-flowing and subjected to hydropower production. The advantages of our approach compared to other analytical methods are: (i) it displays a great amount of information without oversimplification; (ii) it takes into account changes in the intensity, timing and frequency of the sub-daily flows, without needing a priori defined thresholds to identify hydropeaking events; and (iii) it supports the Water Framework Directive goal. Specifically, results from applications of our graphical method agree with Sauterleute and Charmasson (2014) analytical method. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Anthropogenic versus mineral aerosols in the stimulation of microbial planktonic communities in coastal waters of the northwestern Mediterranean Sea	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Mediterranean Sea; Saharan dust; Anthropogenic aerosols; Chlorophyll; Bacteria; Copper	DISSOLVED ORGANIC-CARBON; SAHARAN DUST INPUTS; ATMOSPHERIC DEPOSITION; PHYTOPLANKTON DYNAMICS; MESOCOSM EXPERIMENT; ECOSYSTEM CHANGES; METALS COPPER; LOW-NUTRIENT; NE SPAIN; IMPACT	The atmosphere of the northwestern (NW) Mediterranean Sea is affected by continuous inputs of anthropogenic aerosols and episodic Saharan dust events. These atmospheric inputs deliver to the surface waters high amounts of macronutrients and trace metals that can constitute their main source at certain times of the year. The effect of both anthropogenic and crustal particles over the autotrophic and heterotrophic planktonic community assembles was evaluated through three microcosm experiments carried out in the summer of 2013 and in the winter and spring of 2014 at an urban coastal location of the NW Mediterranean (Barcelona, Spain). Particles were added to seawater at a concentration of 0.8 mgl(-1). The results showed that (i) a greater stimulation of the whole community was observed in summer and spring than in winter; (ii) both kinds of aerosols produced an increase in the growth of phytoplankton, although the stimulation of nanoeukaryotes was significantly larger with anthropogenic aerosols; and (iii) bacterial abundance increased more with mineral dust, whereas bacterial production was more stimulated with anthropogenic inputs. Overall, the effect of atmospheric particles was dependent on their composition and solubility in seawater, as well as on the initial biogeochemical conditions present in the seawater and had the potential to change the net metabolic balance of the microbial planktonic community.

The proposed methodology was applied to 345 real samples from nine stations of a Mediterranean area in Spain, and the risk was assessed for adult, children and infants. Forty pesticides were detected with average concentrations ranging from 8 to 30,000 pg m(-3). Each station showed its specific pesticide profile, which is linked to the different types of crops around each station. For adults, children and infants the estimated chronic inhalation risk, expressed as Hazard Quotient (HQ), was <1 for all pesticides. The cumulative exposure for organophosphates, neonicotinoids, benzimidazoles, carbamates, microorganism and triazoles pesticides (HI, Hazard Index) were <1 for the three groups of populations assessed. For infants, the cancer risk estimated for the detected pesticides classified as possible and potential carcinogens were lower than 1.0 E-06, except for carbendazim and hexythiazox.

J	Serrano, MA; Canada, J; Moreno, JC; Gurrea, G				Serrano, Maria-Antonia; Canada, Javier; Carlos Moreno, Juan; Gurrea, Gonzalo			Solar ultraviolet doses and vitamin D in a northern mid-latitude	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Ultraviolet radiation; Ultraviolet erythemal irradiance; Ultraviolet vitamin D irradiance; Ultraviolet index; Vitamin D dose	NONMELANOMA SKIN-CANCER; D DEFICIENCY; SPANISH SCHOOLCHILDREN; SUN EXPOSURE; B IRRADIANCE; RADIATION; SUNLIGHT; HEALTH; CALIBRATION; PREVENTION	Solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation is one of the most important factors in the development of skin cancer in human, solar erythema and skin aging. Nevertheless, numerous studies have shown the benefits of UV solar radiation in moderate doses, such as the reduction of blood pressure and mental health, treatment of various diseases, and the synthesis of vitamin D in the skin. This paper analyses data from solar ultraviolet erythemal (UVER) irradiance in W/m(2) measured in a northern mid-latitude as Valencia (Spain) for the period 2003-2010. To estimate effective solar UV radiation in the production of vitamin D (UVD) we used the relationship proposed by McKenzie et al. (2009). It was obtained for one month for each season the minimum exposure time needed around solar noon and at 9 UTC and 15 UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) to obtain the recommended daily dose of 1000 IU. Also, it has been calculated time for erythema induction around solar noon for the same months. The median UVER daily dose during the summer months was 4000 J/m(2) day, and 700 J/m(2) day in winter. With regard to UVD, the median UVD daily dose in summer season was 7700 J/m(2) day, and in winter it was 1000 J/m(2) day. Around noon in January it takes more than two hours of solar exposure to obtain the recommended daily dose of vitamin D, whereas the rest of the year range between 7 min on July and 31 min on October. For the same months around noon, exposure times to produce erythema were obtained, these being of higher value to the previous. The results show that it is difficult to obtain the recommended vitamin D doses in winter in a northern mid-latitude, as the human body is almost entirely covered in this season.

J	Pardo, G; Moral, R; del Prado, A				Pardo, Guillermo; Moral, Raul; del Prado, Agustin			SIMSWASTE-AD - A modelling framework for the environmental assessment of agricultural waste management strategies: Anaerobic digestion	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Biogas; Manure; GHG emissions; Modelling; LCA; Mitigation	GREENHOUSE-GAS EMISSIONS; LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; ULTIMATE METHANE YIELDS; SOLID-LIQUID SEPARATION; ENERGY CROPS; BIOGAS PLANTS; CO-DIGESTION; CATTLE SLURRY; NITROUS-OXIDE; GHG EMISSIONS	On-farm anaerobic digestion (AD) has been promoted due to its improved environmental performance, which is based on a number of life cycle assessments (LCA). However, the influence of site-specific conditions and practices on AD performance is rarely captured in LCA studies and the effects on C and N cycles are often overlooked. In this paper, a new model for AD (SIMSWASTE-AD) is described in full and tested against a selection of available measured data. Good agreement between modelled and measured values was obtained, reflecting the model capability to predict biogas production (r(2) = 0.84) and N mineralization (r(2) = 0.85) under a range of substrate mixtures and operational conditions. SIMSWASTE-AD was also used to simulate C and N flows and GHG emissions for a set of scenarios exploring different AD technology levels, feedstock mixtures and climate conditions. The importance of post-digestion emissions and its relationship with the AD performance have been stressed as crucial factors to reduce the net GHG emissions (-75%) but also to enhance digestate fertilizer potential (15%). Gas tight digestate storage with residual biogas collection is highly recommended (especially in temperate to warm climates), as well as those operational conditions that can improve the process efficiency on degrading VS (e.g. thermophilic range, longer hydraulic retention time). Beyond the effects on the manure management stage, SIMSWASTE-AD also aims to help account for potential effects of AD on other stages by providing the C and nutrient flows. While primarily designed to be applied within the SIMSDAIRY modelling framework, it can also interact with other models implemented in integrated approaches. Such system scope assessments are essential for stakeholders and policy makers in order to develop effective strategies for reducing GHG emissions and environmental issues in the agriculture sector.

The main goal of this study is to assess the temporal dynamic of soil moisture to better understand the water-growth relationship of Pinus halepensis forests in semiarid areas. The estimates of modelled soil moisture and measured tree growth were used at four sites dominated by afforested Pinus halepensis Mill. in south-eastern Spain with 300 to 609 mm mean annual precipitation. Firstly, dendrochronological samples were extracted and the widths of annual tree rings were measured to compute basal area increments (BAI). Secondly, soil moisture was estimated over 20 hydrological years (1992-2012) by means of the HYDROBAL ecohydrological model. Finally, the tree growth was linked, to mean monthly and seasonal temperature, precipitation and soil moisture. Results depict the effect of soil moisture on growth (BAI) and explain 69-73% of the variance in semiarid forests, but only 51% in the subhumid forests. This highlights the fact that that soil moisture is a suitable and promising variable to explain growth variations of afforested Pinus halepensis in semiarid conditions and useful for guiding adaptation plans to respond pro-actively to water-related global challenges.

The hypotheses are tested using a multilevel analysis that employs an unprecedented number of objective indicators of environmental degradation, using the World Values Survey 6th wave (2010-2014). The results support the degradation hypotheses, where the importance of water scarcity in a country and national biodiversity are the major variables that explain individual environmental concern among all the indicators of environmental degradation. The affluence hypothesis is rejected and the postmaterialist theory is supported only at the individual level.

Our modelling toolkit provides real time simulations of 2D magneto-mechanical quantities for superconductor (SC)/permanent magnet structures. The source code is open and may be customised for a variety of configurations. Ultimately, it relies on the variational statement of the critical state model for the superconducting component and has been verified against experimental data for YBaCuO/NdFeB assemblies. On a quantitative basis, the values of the arising forces, induced superconducting currents, as well as a plot of the magnetic field lines are displayed upon selection of an arbitrary trajectory of the magnet in the vicinity of the SC. The stability issues related to the cooling process, as well as the maximum attainable forces for a given material and geometry are immediately observed. Due to the complexity of the problem, a strategy based on cluster computing, database compression, and real-time post-processing on the device has been implemented.

The aim of this paper is to determine the elements of minimum entropy in the families Posn and Irrn. Let lambda(n) be the unique real root of the polynomial x(n) - 2x - 1 in (1,+ infinity). We explicitly construct an irreducible n- periodic tree pattern Q(n) whose entropy is log(lambda(n)). For n = m(k), where m is a prime, we prove that this entropy is minimum in the set Pos(n). Since the pattern Q(n) is irreducible, Qn also minimizes the entropy in the family Irr(n).
