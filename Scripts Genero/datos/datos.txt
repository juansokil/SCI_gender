Characterization and safety evaluation	FOOD CONTROL			English	Article						Aging; Daily intake; Mineral content; Oak wood; Orujo	ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES; SUGARCANE SPIRITS; SHERRY BRANDIES; CERTIFIED BRAND; HEAVY-METALS; COPPER; SPAIN; WINES; OAK; COGNAC	Orujo is the name of the Galician (NW of Spain) grape marc distillate. The usual way of Orujo consumption is as young brandy due to the lack of knowledge about the most appropriate type of barrel for aging and the high cost of the final product. However in the past years, demand for this aged distillate has increased. This manuscript has a double aim: contribute to the analytical characterization of this traditional beverage in terms of mineral constituents and evaluate the influence of the species of wooden barrel in the mineral content. Analyses were performed by flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry (Cu, Mn, Zn, Fe, Ca and Mg), flame atomic emission spectrophotometry (Na and K) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (Al, Cd and Pb). Orujos aged in Quercus alba showed significant higher value for the majority of metals whereas those aged in Quercus pet raea showed the lowest contents. K, Na and Ca were the more abundant minerals in the analyzed distillates. The PCA analysis clearly showed a good separation of samples in terms of mineral constituents. The very low concentrations of all minerals evaluated indicated the good manufactured process and the consumer safety of aged Orujos. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Slices were spiked with Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella enterica (three strains each, <2 log CFU/g), dried by the QDS process (R), vacuum packed, high pressure treated at 600 MPa and stored under refrigeration for 112 days. Results of the challenge test showed that L monocytogenes could only be eliminated from acidified smoked (AS) -S and -F processed ham slices at the end of storage, while S. enterica was present in all non-pressurized slices. The safest hams were those pressurized, especially AS-S hams, where L. monocytogenes was eliminated from 25 g of product immediately after HP treatment and S. enterica after 14 days. Compared with standard processing, NaCl-free processing showed lower levels of pathogens in non-pressurized slices but their elimination was delayed in pressurized ham slices. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

A. acidoterrestris produces several chemical off-odour compounds which cause the fruit juice spoilage. The purpose of this research was to evaluate the effect of the combination of asthermal treatment with natural antimicrobials (nisin, citral and limonene) on the survival and recovery of A. acidoterrestris spores. Heat resistance determinations at 95 degrees C in pH 3.5 McIlvaine buffer with or without the addition of these antimicrobials (alone or combined) in the heating or recovery media were performed. None of the antimicrobials reduced the heat resistance of A. acidoterrestris spores when added to the heating medium. However, nisin (1.5 mg L-1) alone was able to reduce the viable counts of this microorganism by more than two log cycles when added to the plating medium, even when no thermal treatment was previously applied. The different combinations of nisin with citral on the recovery medium, showed a strong synergistic effect on A. acidoterrestris. Limonene showed no inhibitory effect in either media (heating and recovery). The addition of natural antimicrobials such as nisin or citral, which would not affect the flavor or taste of citrus juices, alone or even combined, can help to the control of A. acidoterrestris.

Physicochemical parameters, microbial counts and biogenic amines during manufacture as well as the sensorial characteristics of the final products were determined both in control and in inoculated sausages. The use of starter cultures significantly (P < 0.05) increased he counts of LAB and Micro coccaceae + Staphylococcaceae, and provoked an earlier drop of the pH values and the fall, even the disappearance, of the Enterobacteriaceae. The inoculated batches showed significantly (P < 0.05) lower contents of tyramine, putrescine and cadaverine and of total biogenic amines, and they received higher scores for overall acceptability when they were sensory analyzed. Results obtained in this work indicated that starter culture consisting of L. sakei CECT5764 + S. equorum SA25 + L. acidophilus CECT903 was the best culture for this type of sausage.

The nose has been applied to monitor fresh pork sausage ageing. Sausages were packaged together with the disposable array in a modified packaging atmosphere (30% CO2, 70% N-2) and colour changes were measured at seven day intervals. Simultaneously, microbiological and sensory analyses were performed. Colour modulations of the chromogenic array were processed with standard analytical tools, including principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares (PLS). According to the PCA, the array was able to monitor the sausage spoilage process and to distinguish between each sampled day. Moreover, the PLS statistical analysis of the chromogenic data displayed a linear correlation between the predicted and measured values of the storage days, mesophilic bacteria (cfu g(-1)) and the sensory score with regression coefficients of 0.9300, 0.9472 and 0.9381, respectively.

We report here on temperature profiles measured in winter and summer months in a retail supply chain and their predicted impact on the fate of the pathogen in fresh-cut lettuce. Time and temperature data were recorded in individual packages within cases of lettuce in the bottom, middle and top layers of pallets distributed from a processing facility to retail storage. Measurements indicated there were occasional increases in temperature during either season and that temperatures were >5 degrees C for longer periods of time during the summer. A stochastic simulation model based on time and temperature distributions was constructed in @RISK (TM) to predict the fate of E. coli 0157:F17. The output from the model demonstrated a range of possible outcomes for the time-temperature profiles measured in the commercial supply chain, ranging from slight growth to die-off. The outputs of the stochastic simulations were similar to analytical simulations based on actual times and temperatures experienced by product in the supply chain. The distributions presented in the current model could be incorporated in quantitative risk assessments to improve predictions about the prevalence and fate of E. coli 0157:H7 in fresh-cut lettuce supply chains.

Two hydrocolloids, sodium caseinate (NaCas) and methylcellulose (MC), and two bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria (LAB), Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus reuteri, were tested. Bioactive cultures were added directly to the film forming solution and films were obtained by casting. In order to study the impact of the incorporation of bacterial cells into the biopolymer Matrix, the water vapour permeability, optical and mechanical properties of the dry films were evaluated. Furthermore, the survival of LAB and the antimicrobial potential of bioactive films against L. innocua were studied. Results showed that the use of lactic acid bacteria altered the film's physical properties. Films enriched with bacterial cells exhibit higher gloss and transparency whereas no significant modifications were observed in terms of tensile properties. These films were less-effective water vapour barriers, since a significant increase can be observed in the WVP values. As far as food safety is concerned, these films are an interesting, novel approach. In refrigeration conditions, these films permit a complete inhibition of L innocua for a week. Viability of LAB was higher in sodium caseinate films, although bacteriocin production was greater in polysaccharide matrix. The best results were obtained for films made of methylcellulose, without differences between the two lactic acid bacteria tested. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Application of experimental design and response surface methodology to optimize the procedure to obtain a bactericide and highly antioxidant aqueous extract from orange peels	FOOD CONTROL			English	Article						Natural extracts; Polyphenols Food spoilage; Natural preservatives; Escherichia coli; Listeria innocua	GRAPE; ANTIBACTERIAL	In recent years there is a growing demand for healthy and safe food, without added preservatives or synthetic antioxidants. In this regard, plant extracts have promising future due to their high contents of bioactive compounds, especially in phenolic and polyphenolic compounds that exhibit antimicrobial and antioxidant activities. For this reason, the plant extracts could form the basis of many applications, including the preservation of fresh and processed foods. In this work, the methodology to obtain orange peel extracts with high bioactive properties is presented. To adjust the extraction conditions, experimental design and response surface methodology were applied to establish the optimum value of all the experimental variables that have influence in the extraction system. Total phenolic contents and antioxidant activity values were used as response parameter. The peel extracts, obtained with the proposed methodology, exhibited a high content of phenolic compounds, high antioxidant and antimicrobial activity, against Escherichia coli and Listeria innocua (in-vitro experiments). Finally, to demonstrate the feasibility of the peel extracts, they were used as natural additive in apple juice reducing significantly juice browning and the microbial load for both bacteria.

Application of a novel pathogenicity marker in a multiplex real-time PCR method to assess total and pathogenic Vibrio vulnificus in food and environmental samples	FOOD CONTROL			English	Article						Vibrio vulnificus; vcgC; pilF; PNC; PNCC; qPCR	SALMONELLA SPP.; OYSTERS; PARAHAEMOLYTICUS; ASSAY; STRAINS; VALIDATION; SHELLFISH; GENOTYPES; CHOLERAE; BACTERIA	Pathogenic species of Vibrio genus, including Vibrio vulnificus, constitute a great challenge for food control agencies and a threat for consumers. V. vulnificus can appear in bivalve mollusks such as oysters, clams, and mussels. In addition, water, sediment, and plankton, have been described as reservoirs for this pathogen which constitutes the leading cause of death by consuming seafood in the United States. The aim of this study was to develop and pre-validate a rapid and reliable multiplex real-time PCR (qPCR) method for total and pathogenic V. vulnificus detection. Peptone, Sodium Chloride, Cellobiose (PNC) broth, with and without Colistin (PNCC) was evaluated according to international methods (ISO). The capacity of these broths to recover low numbers of pathogenic V. vulnificus in the presence of high numbers of interfering microorganisms was assessed. Finally, were used for food and environmental samples enrichment. In addition three different DNA extraction protocols were compared, but one of them proved to be better than the others regarding DNA concentration and purity obtained, and also regarding Ct values and final fluorescence obtained by qPCR. A qPCR efficiency above 90% was obtained, covering five orders of magnitude. The complete method achieved low limit of detection (3 cfu/25 g). All quality parameters of the method (relative sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy) returned values over 90% after analyzing 45 spiked samples. These results were obtained for all the targets analyzed (vvhA, vcgC and pilF). In this study the complete qPCR method developed was applied to 28 natural samples including a wide variety of seafood types and environmental samples (water), but no positive samples were detected for either target.

Use of impedance spectroscopy for predicting freshness of sea bream (Sparus aurata)	FOOD CONTROL			English	Article						Sea bream; Freshness; Impedance spectroscopy; Non-destructive sensor; PLS regression; Linear discriminant analysis	BASS DICENTRARCHUS-LABRAX; SALMON SALMO-SALAR; SHELF-LIFE; QUALITY; FILLETS; ICE	In the present study, the use of a rapid portable system based on impedance spectroscopy to assess fish freshness has been tested. The evolution of different physical and chemical parameters (moisture, fat, pH and TVBN) and impedance measurements (modulus and phase at different frequencies) of six different batches of sea bream (Sparus aurata) were analysed. Impedance spectroscopy was able to classify raw matter into six groups according to composition differences, and also to classify those samples stored for a time of between 0 and 15 days into different groups according to degree of freshness. TVB-N is one of the most usual parameters to assess shelf life periods of fish samples; the coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.72 obtained in the Partial Least Squares regression for this parameter confirmed the potential application of the impedance spectroscopy for predicting sea bream freshness.

Five pomegranate juices varying in flavor character were evaluated by consumers in Estonia, Spain, Thailand, and the United States. In this study the consumers evaluated overall acceptability and flavor, sweet, sour, fruity, and pomegranate flavor liking. Also, Just About Right (JAR) questions were answered for those same attributes. The results suggested that although some samples varied in their liking across countries, larger differences in acceptance were found between consumer clusters across countries. These data suggest that individual consumer variation is greater than country specific variation. In addition, factors such as taste sensitivity or prior exposure rather than flavor are important in acceptability of pomegranate juices. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Investigation of the number of consumers necessary to obtain stable sample and descriptor configurations from check-all-that-apply (CATA) questions	FOOD QUALITY AND PREFERENCE			English	Article						Check-all-that-apply questions; Sensory characterization; Consumers; Bootstrap; Research methodology	TEXTURE-PERCEPTION; SORTING TASK; SIZE; ASSESSORS; WINES	As the use of check-all-that-apply (CATA) questions for consumers to aid sensory product characterization gains popularity the need for developing guidelines regarding best practice increases. An important issue in the design of studies including CATA questions is the number of consumers that are necessary to obtain stable results. In this context, the aim of the present work was to study the stability of sample and descriptor configurations obtained using CATA questions with consumers, by means of a bootstrapping resampling approach. Data from 13 consumer studies were analyzed, differing in number of consumers, product category, number of samples, degree of difference among samples and number and type of descriptors in the CATA question. For each study, 1000 random subsets of different number of consumers were generated from the original data set. For each consumer virtual panel, sample and descriptor configurations were obtained using Correspondence Analysis and the concordance between them and the reference configurations (obtained with all the consumers) were computed using the regression vector (RV) coefficient. The RV coefficients of sample and descriptor configurations increased with the number of consumers, suggesting an increase in the stability of the configurations. Results showed that the number of consumers necessary to yield fully stable configurations depended on the degree of difference among samples, the complexity of the sensory space and the type of descriptors included in the CATA question. Across the 13 data sets analysed, results suggested that when working with widely different samples, 60-80 consumers can be regarded as a reasonable compromise to get stable sample and descriptor configurations. However, it is recommended to check, a posteriori, the stability of sample and descriptor configurations using a stability index based on bootstrapping. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The in vitro effects on the human immune system of different beta-lactoglobulin tryptic-digested fractions separated by membrane filtration were evaluated, analysing the proliferation, cytokine secretion and differentiation of human peripheral blood cells. This procedure allowed the enrichment of peptide sets with specific features, suggesting that the differences in the peptidic composition were related to their immune function. The fraction enriched in large and acid peptides was able to induce Th1 responses, whereas fractions containing short peptides were involved in monocyte activation increasing TNF alpha secretion. Moreover, one of these fractions was able to induce TGF beta secretion and regulatory T cell differentiation, key mechanisms by which whey-derived peptides could impair allergic and inflammatory responses. No impact on immune cells was triggered by the unfractionated hydrolysate, supporting the use of membrane-fractionating techniques for obtaining immune bioactiveenriched fractions.

Controlled enterolysin A-mediated lysis and production of angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitory bovine skim milk hydrolysates by recombinant Lactococcus lactis	INTERNATIONAL DAIRY JOURNAL			English	Article							CONTROLLED GENE-EXPRESSION; ACID BACTERIA; SYSTEM; FERMENTATION; OPTIMIZATION; PEPTIDES; SEQUENCE; STRAIN	Cloning of the enterolysin A (EnlA) gene (enlA) from Enterococcus faecalis DAC9 into the pMSP3545-derived pMLG2-protein expression vector encoding EnlA under control of the inducible P-nisA promoter permitted the controlled release and heterologous expression of mature EnlA by Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris NZ9000 and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis IL1403. The nisin-induced expression of enlA by L. lactis NZ9000 (pMLG2) and L. lactis IL1403 (pMLG2), grown in GM17 or bovine skim milk (BSM), caused a noticeable reduction of the optical density (OD600) of the cultures and death of the growing cells. However, a high angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activity (ACE-IA) was only observed in the BSM-derived hydrolysates of L. lactis IL1403 (pMLG2) after 48 h-induction with nisin. Analysis of these hydrolysates by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry permitted the identification of major peptide fragments with known ACE-IA or sharing at least three C-terminal residues with those displaying ACE-IA.

Polymorphisms of Helicobacter pylori signaling pathway genes and gastric cancer risk in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer-Eurgast cohort	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CANCER			English	Article						gastric cancer; genetic susceptibility; Helicobacter pylori; NOD2; CD14	EPSTEIN-BARR-VIRUS; SINGLE-NUCLEOTIDE POLYMORPHISMS; FUNCTIONAL POLYMORPHISM; GASTRODUODENAL DISEASES; PROMOTER POLYMORPHISM; CHINESE POPULATION; ASSOCIATION; INFECTION; CD14; CARCINOMA	Helicobacter pylori is a recognized causal factor of noncardia gastric cancer (GC). Lipopolysaccharide and peptidoglycan of this bacterium are recognized by CD14, TLR4 and NOD2 human proteins, while NFKB1 activates the transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines to elicit an immune response. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in these genes have been associated with GC in different populations. We genotyped 30 SNPs of these genes, in 365 gastric adenocarcinomas and 1,284 matched controls from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer cohort. The association with GC and its histological and anatomical subtypes was analyzed by logistic regression and corrected for multiple comparisons. Using a log-additive model, we found a significant association between SNPs in CD14, NOD2 and TLR4 with GC risk. However, after applying the multiple comparisons tests only the NOD2 region remained significant (p=0.009). Analysis according to anatomical subtypes revealed NOD2 and NFKB1 SNPs associated with noncardia GC and CD14 SNPs associated with cardia GC, while analysis according to histological subtypes showed that CD14 was associated with intestinal but not diffuse GC. The multiple comparisons tests confirmed the association of NOD2 with noncardia GC (p=0.0003) and CD14 with cardia GC (p=0.01). Haplotype analysis was in agreement with single SNP results for NOD2 and CD14 genes. From these results, we conclude that genetic variation in NOD2 associates with noncardia GC while variation in CD14 is associated with cardia GC. What's new? Variations in immune genes appear to play an important role in determining susceptibility to gastric cancer linked to Helicobacter pylori colonization of gastric mucosa. However, little is known about the influence of variation on anatomical localization and histological subtype of this malignancy. The results of this study first confirm that NOD2 and CD14, which encode proteins that recognize H. pylori lipopolysaccharide and peptidoglycan, are significantly associated with gastric cancer risk and second indicate that NOD2 associates with noncardia and CD14 with cardia gastric cancer. The differential effects of variation on the anatomical localization of disease warrant further investigation.

Our study illustrates the immune escape of HLA class I-negative tumor cells and chronological sequence of appearance of tumor 2m gene mutation in successive lesions obtained from a patient with metastatic melanoma. We observed a gradual decrease in HLA expression in consecutive lesions with few HLA-negative nodules in the primary tumor and the emergence of a totally negative lesion at later stages of the disease. We detected loss of 2m in 2m-negative nests of the primary tumor caused by a combination of two alterations: (i) a mutation (G to T substitution) in codon 67 in exon 2 of 2m gene, producing a stop codon and (ii) loss of the second gene copy by loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in chromosome 15. The same 2m mutation was found in a homogeneously 2m-negative metastasis 10 months later and in a cell line established from a biopsy of a postvaccination lymph node. Microsatellite analysis revealed the presence of LOH in chromosomes 6 and 15 in tumor samples, showing an accumulation of chromosomal loss at specific short tandem repeats in successive metastases during disease progression. HLA loss correlated with decreased tumor CD8+ T-cell infiltration. Early incidence of 2m defects can cause an immune selection and expansion of highly aggressive melanoma clones with irreversible genetic defects causing total loss of HLA class I expression and should be taken into consideration as a therapeutic target in the development of cancer immunotherapy protocols. What's new? In order for immunotherapy to work, tumor cells must first present tumor-associated peptides on their surface via the HLA class I complex. In this chronological study of melanoma progression, the authors suggest that early loss of the beta2-microglobulin (2m) component of the HLA class I complex allows some tumor cells to evade the immune system. This, in turn, gives these cells a selective advantage for growth, metastasis, and resistance to immunotherapy. 2m/HLA class I expression may thus provide both a biomarker and a therapeutic target in the development of cancer immunotherapy protocols.

Dietary sources of N-nitroso compounds and bladder cancer risk: Findings from the Los Angeles bladder cancer study	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CANCER			English	Article						bladder cancer; N-nitroso compounds; nitrosamines; processed meats	URINARY-BLADDER; MEAT INTAKE; ENDOGENOUS FORMATION; PROSPECTIVE COHORT; CIGARETTE-SMOKING; BIOGENIC-AMINES; PROCESSED MEAT; TOTAL FLUID; RED MEAT; NUTRITION	N-Nitroso compounds (NOCs) have been proposed as possible bladder carcinogens. The main sources of exogenous exposure to NOCs are cigarette smoke and diet, particularly processed (i.e., nitrite-treated) meats. Perhaps more importantly, NOCs can be formed endogenously from dietary precursors such as nitrate, nitrite and amines. Heme has been shown to increase endogenous nitrosation. We examined the role of dietary sources of NOCs and NOC precursors as potential bladder cancer risk factors using data from the Los Angeles Bladder Cancer Study, a population-based case-control study. Dietary and demographic information was collected from 1,660 bladder cancer cases and 1,586 controls via a structured questionnaire. Intake of liver and of salami/pastrami/corned beef, were both statistically significantly associated with risk of bladder cancer in this study, particularly among nonsmokers. Heme intake was also statistically significantly associated with risk of bladder cancer among nonsmokers only. When considering NOC precursors, risk was consistently higher among subjects with concurrent high intake of nitrate and high intake of the different meats (sources of amines and nitrosamines). Results of this study are consistent with a role of dietary sources of NOC precursors from processed meats in bladder cancer risk, suggesting consumption of meats with high amine and heme content such as salami and liver as a risk factor for bladder cancer. In addition, any effect of consuming these meats may be greater when accompanied by high nitrate intake. What's new? The role of diet in bladder cancer is only partially understood. Here the authors investigate the role of dietary sources of N-nitroso compounds (NOCs) in bladder cancer risk, taking into account both ingestion of preformed NOCs as well as the often overlooked role of endogenous NOC formation. NOCs can be formed endogenously from dietary precursors like nitrate, nitrite and amines. Based on a population-based case-control study, the findings support a role for dietary precursors of endogenous NOC formation as risk factors for bladder cancer, suggesting an additional route of carcinogenic exposure in the bladder that deserves consideration and further study.

However, the metabolism of these hormones is altered as a consequence of liver damage and they may have clinical utility as HCC risk markers. A case-control study was nested within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition cohort and included 125 incident HCC cases and 247 individually matched controls. Testosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and IGF-I were analyzed by immunoassays. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated by conditional logistic regression. The area under the receiver operating curves (AUC) was calculated to assess HCC predictive ability of the tested models. After adjustments for epidemiological variables (body mass index, smoking, ethanol intake, hepatitis and diabetes) and liver damage (a score based on albumin, bilirubin, aspartate aminotransaminase, alanine aminotransaminase, gamma-glutamyltransferase and alkaline phosphatase concentrations), only SHBG remained significantly associated with risk [OR for top versus bottom tertile of 3.86 (1.32-11.3), p(trend) = 0.009]. As a single factor SHBG had an AUC of 0.81 (0.75-0.86). A small, but significant increase in AUC was observed when SHBG was added to a model including the liver damage score and epidemiological variables (from 0.89 to 0.91, p = 0.02) and a net reclassification of 0.47% (0.45-0.48). The observed associations of HCC with prediagnostic SHBG, free testosterone and IGF-I concentrations are in directions opposite to that expected under the etiological hypotheses. SHBG has a potential to be tested as prediagnostic risk marker for HCC. (c) 2013 UICC What's new? Testosterone and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) are implicated in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), though their involvement may be more complex than previously thought. Here, in a unique study population with low prevalence of hepatitis infections, an association was detected between HCC risk and increased levels of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and IGF-1 prior to diagnosis. Neither testosterone nor IGF-1, however, was found to have an etiological influence in the decade before diagnosis. The results suggest that SHBG and IGF-I should be considered in the clinical evaluation of patients at increased risk of HCC.

J	Cano-Cuenca, N; Pozoc, JESG; Jordan, J				Cano-Cuenca, Nieves; Solis-Garcia del Pozoc, Julian E.; Jordan, Joaquin			Evidence for the Efficacy of Latrepirdine (Dimebon) Treatment for Improvement of Cognitive Function: A Meta-Analysis	JOURNAL OF ALZHEIMERS DISEASE			English	Article						Alzheimer's disease; clinical trials; cognition function; dimebon; Huntington's disease; schizophrenia	ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; TRANSGENIC MICE; DOUBLE-BLIND; HUNTINGTONS-DISEASE; CLINICAL-TRIALS; MINOCYCLINE; PATHOLOGY; CYTOPROTECTION; MITOCHONDRIA; IMPAIRMENT	Over the last few years, latrepirdine, a demode antihistamine drug, has been proposed to be useful for treating neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Huntington's diseases, and more recently schizophrenia. The mechanisms and pharmacological targets that are responsible for the beneficial effects on neurodegenerative diseases remain unknown. But it has been proposed that latrepirdine may modulate several targets including voltage-gate Ca+2 channels, mitochondrial permeability pore transition, or several neurotransmitter receptors. Herein, we present a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to ascertain the efficacy and safety of latrepirdine on cognitive function. By doing a search in electronic databases, we found five clinical trials in which the effect of latrepirdine on cognition function has been studied, and this was evaluated using MMSE, ADAS-cog, ADCS-ADL, and NPI scores. Latrepirdine generally presented a good safety profile; it was well tolerated when given alone or in combination with a variety of other drugs. We observed heterogeneous results between trials; latrepirdine failed to exert a significant beneficial effect although it tended to improve cognitive scores. The only significant benefit that we found was for the NPI score in Alzheimer's disease patients.

On this basis, two ionic liquids, butyltrimethylammoniumbis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide, [BTMA][NTf2], and tributylmethylammoniumbis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide, [TBMA][NTf2], were studied through ternary liquid+ liquid equilibrium (LLE) of {alkane(1) + alcohol (2) + IL(3)} at T = 298.15 K and atmospheric pressure in order to consider the effect of ionic liquid cation alkyl chain length on the extraction process. The ILs capability as azeotrope breakers was determined by the calculation of parameters such as solute distribution ratio, b, and selectivity, S and this capability was compared with other bis (trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide based ionic liquids from literature. The consistency of tie-line data was ascertained by applying the Othmer-Tobias and Hand equations. Finally, the experimental LLE were correlated by the Non Random Two Liquid (NRTL) thermodynamic model. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

From density and refractive index data, the thermal expansion coefficient, molar refractions and molar refractions for the pure ionic liquid were calculated. Besides, a thermal analysis was carried out for the pure ionic liquid using a differential scanning calorimeter. Linear equations were used to fit the density, speed of sound, refractive index and molar isobaric heat capacity data, while the viscosity data were fitted using common equations such as Arrhenius, Vogel-Fulcher-Tamman (VFT), Litovitz, and fluidity. Furthermore, experimental density, speed of sound and refractive index data for binary mixtures with alcohols and their derived properties (excess molar volume, and excess molar isentropic compression) were determined over the whole composition range from T = (298.15, 303.15 and 308.15) K. The excess properties were satisfactorily fitted by Redlich-Kister equation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This equation allows one to rewrite the well-known Trouton, Guldberg, van Laar and Guggenheim rules in terms of the acentric factor x. The original forms of these empirical rules are recovered for some particular values of x. The proposed rules are checked by analyzing National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) data on the liquid-vapor coexistence curve for 105 fluids.

Accurate thermodynamic characterization of a synthetic coal mine methane mixture	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL THERMODYNAMICS			English	Article						Coal mine methane; Density measurements; Single sinker densimeter; GERG-2008 equation of state	SINGLE-SINKER DENSIMETER; FORCE TRANSMISSION ERROR; EQUATION-OF-STATE; DENSITY-MEASUREMENTS; PRESSURE; TEMPERATURE; NITROGEN; MPA; RANGE; GASES	In the last few years, coal mine methane (CMM) has gained significance as a potential non-conventional gas fuel. The progressive depletion of common fossil fuels reserves and, on the other hand, the positive estimates of CMM resources as a by-product of mining promote this fuel gas as a promising alternative fuel. The increasing importance of its exploitation makes it necessary to check the capability of the present-day models and equations of state for natural gas to predict the thermophysical properties of gases with a considerably different composition, like CMM. In this work, accurate density measurements of a synthetic CMM mixture are reported in the temperature range from (250 to 400) K and pressures up to 15 MPa, as part of the research project EMRP ENG01 of the European Metrology Research Program for the characterization of non-conventional energy gases. Experimental data were compared with the densities calculated with the GERG-2008 equation of state. Relative deviations between experimental and estimated densities were within a 0.2% band at temperatures above 275 K, while data at 250 K as well as at 275 K and pressures above 10 MPa showed higher deviations.

The main results obtained depend on the nodal behavior of the potential appearing in the partial differential equation, on the sign of the nonlinear flux on the boundary and on the relationship the exponents p > 1, from the reaction in the partial differential equation, and q > 1, from the nonlinear flux on the boundary. This paper is focused to the case p > 2q - 1. The main technical tools used are the Characterization of the Strong Maximum Principle given by H. Amann and J. Lopez-Gomez [3], monotonicity technics, blow-up arguments and bifurcation. The results obtained in this paper are the natural extensions or complements of the previous ones obtained by S.

J	Mendez, I; Cutillas, IM				Mendez, Ildefonso; Cutillas, Isabel M.			Has immigration affected Spanish presidential elections results?	JOURNAL OF POPULATION ECONOMICS			English	Article						Immigration; Electoral outcomes; Instrumental variables; National identity	SPAIN; ATTITUDES	Between 1998 and 2008, the immigrant share in Spain jumped from less than 3 % to more than 13 %. We provide bounds on the effect of immigration inflows on natives' election outcomes by considering alternative assumptions about nationalized immigrants' participation rates and voting behavior. We find that Latin-American immigration increased natives' participation rate and their support for the major leftist party (Socialist Workers' Party) over the major conservative party (People's Party (PP)). Conversely, African immigration only increased natives' support for anti-immigration formations relative to the PP while leaving unaffected their participation rate. The estimated effects are of modest size in all cases. We provide suggestive evidence that economic factors cannot account for such a heterogeneity in the effects of interest by immigrants' ethnic groups. We argue that Spanish natives' attitudes towards immigrants are mainly driven by noneconomic factors like dissimilarities between natives and immigrants in language, religion, and race.

Tasks were performed by 168 participants (aged between 45 and 91 years) who were grouped according to age and level of education. Multivariate analyses of variance were applied to Z scores calculated from intersubject coefficients of variation. When the variance associated with education was discounted prior to analysis, a disproportionate increase in cognitive diversity was observed in participants over 75 years of age. When cognitive diversity was analyzed in relation to age and education in the three youngest age groups, participants with a low level of education displayed higher diversity in most attentional tasks from 66 years of age. In participants with a high level of education, diversity was lower for all attentional tasks considered from 56 years of age. Vocabulary knowledge was the most sensitive to education-related cognitive diversity. The diversifying effect of the relationship between education and diversity on fluid cognitive performance appeared to reverse and become a homogenizing effect with increasing age.

The study is based on the analysis of H-1 HRMAS NMR spectra of tomato pur e using a combination of partial least squares (PLS) and assigned signal analysis (ASA). In agreement with genetic, morphological and taste characteristics of the tomatoes studied, the analysis of the NMR data allows two groups of samples to be differentiated. The type of culture and climatic conditions can reduce the compositional differences. The extension of the compositional changes produced by climatic conditions is variety-depend. Neither grafting nor perlite affect significantly the relative content of primary metabolites. This was not the case for tomatoes grown using the pure hydroponic production system based on the recirculation of nutrient solution, New Growing System NGS (R), which seems to be an effective agricultural approach to improve tomato quality.

The specificity of the assay was verified against a wide representation of animal and plant species. Applicability assessment of the avian real-time PCR was conducted through representative analysis of two types of compound feeds: industrial farm animal feeds (n = 60) subjected to extreme temperatures, and commercial dog and cat feeds (n = 210). Results obtained demonstrated the suitability of the real-time PCR assay to detect the presence of low percentages of highly processed avian material in the feed samples analysed. Although quantification results were well reproducible under the experimental conditions tested, an accurate estimation of the target content in feeds is impossible in practice. Nevertheless, the method may be useful as an alternative tool for traceability purposes within the framework of feed control. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Citrus honey had the lowest levels of all the analysed variables, then rosemary and polyfloral, and honeydew the highest ones. Botanical origin affects the profile of flavonoids and phenolic compounds sufficiently to permit discrimination thanks to the predominance of particular compounds such as: hesperetin (in citrus honey); kaempferol, chrysin, pinocembrin, caffeic acid and naringenin (in rosemary honey) and myricetin, quercetin, galangin and particularly p-coumaric acid (in honeydew honey). The impact of industrial thermal treatments is lower than the expected variability as a consequence of the year of collection, though neither factor has enough influence to alter these constituent compounds to the point of affecting the discrimination of honey by botanical origin.

The separation of alpha s(1)-CN, alpha s(2)-CN, beta-CN and kappa-CN was achieved in only five minutes. Fluorimetric detection enabled better analytical results than photometric detection. Thus, the dynamic ranges of the calibration graphs and detection limits obtained using fluorimetric detection were (mg mL(-1)): alpha s(1)-CN (0.74-10.0, 0.22), alpha s(2)-CN (0.15-10.0, 0.045), beta-CN (0.68-10.0, 0.20) and kappa-CN (0.21-10.0, 0.06). The analytical features of the photometric method, which does not allow the quantification of beta-casein, were (mg mL(-1)): alpha s(1)-CN (1.5-9.0, 0.45), alpha s(2)-CN (1.4-10.0, 0.43) and kappa-CN (0.4-9.0, 0.12). Precision data, expressed as relative standard deviation, ranged between 0.6% and 5.3% for the fluorimetric method and between 2.4% and 6.2% for the photometric method. Both methods were applied to the analysis of three different milk samples, obtaining recoveries in the ranges of 86.6-103.2% and 92.0-106.5% using fluorimetric and photometric detection, respectively.

Samples were obtained over two different seasons in controlled farms from the four categories of pigs described in the Industry Quality Policy (FREE-RANGE: pigs fed exclusively under free-range conditions; FREE-FEED: pigs fed free-range and supplemented with feed; FEED-OUT: pigs fed outdoors with access to grass and a mixed diet; and FEED: pigs fed exclusively a mixed diet). A higher presence of RRR-stereoisomer indicated a greater consumption of the natural form of tocopherol provided by acorns or grass, whereas a higher proportion of S forms were related to a higher mixed diet intake. Validation results showed 90% success in fat sample classification. Analysis of the RRR-stereoisomer together with gamma- and alpha-tocopherol determination can be considered as a potent tool for distinguishing fat from pigs fed under free-range conditions or exclusively with acorns and grass from those receiving a supplemented diet at any time of their fattening phase.

Thus, several families of phytochemicals, such as phenolic acids, isoflavones, flavones, flavonols and glucosinolates were determined in fresh and fresh-cut samples including tomato, carrot, grape, eggplant and broccoli. Both type of products have potential and similar beneficial properties, regarding its content as phytochemicals, except tomato, which should be consumed as fresh. Other factors such as commercial presentation (sliced, grated, diced) and storage conditions (temperature and light) were evaluated observing that in eggplant, the content of phenolic acids is statistically different depending on the presentation. On the other hand, the content of phytochemicals was higher when fresh-cut carrots were stored at 4 degrees C regardless of the presence or absence of light. Multivariate analysis, based on cluster analysis was used as a first approach to distinguish between fresh and fresh-cut samples, obtaining good results except for eggplant and carrot.

Solid samples were extracted with ethyl acetate, while liquid samples were directly injected into the chromatographic system after dilution and filtration without any clean-up step. Chromatographic separation was achieved in less than 4 min. Electrospray (ESI) and atmospheric pressure chemical ionisation (APCI) sources were evaluated, in order to assess matrix effects. The use of ESI source caused strong signal suppression in samples; however, matrix effect was negligible using APCI, allowing quantification with calibration standards prepared in solvent. The method was validated in four different apple matrices (juice, fruit, puree and compote) at two concentrations at the low mu g kg(-1) level. Average recoveries (n = 5) ranged from 71% to 108%, with RSDs lower than 14%. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Some methods use the QR-decomposition of several matrices associated to the equations in the system. To accelerate the computation of those QR-decompositions and consequently the solution of simultaneous equations models, the QR-decomposition of a matrix associated to an equation can be obtained from that of another matrix associated to another equation which contains the variables of the first equation. A Steiner tree can be used, with nodes representing the equations in the model and with edges whose associated weight is the cost of computing the QR-decomposition of an equation from that of another equation. The Steiner tree of the graph associated to the simultaneous equations model gives the order of computation of the QR-decompositions of lowest computational cost. But the number of nodes in the graph is very large, and exact methods to obtain the Steiner tree are not applicable. In this paper, the application of heuristics and metaheuristics to approach the Steiner tree of the graph associated to a simultaneous equations model is considered. A heuristic and a genetic algorithm are presented and analyzed. The quality of the tree obtained and its usability in an algorithm to solve simultaneous equations models efficiently is experimentally studied. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The algorithms are based on the existence of a linear relationship between two proper polynomial parametrizations of the curve, which leads to a triangular polynomial system (with complex unknowns) that can be solved in a very fast way; in particular, curves parametrized by polynomials of serious degrees can be analyzed in a few seconds. In our analysis we provide a good number of theoretical results on symmetries of polynomial curves, algorithms for detecting rotation and mirror symmetry, and closed formulas to determine the symmetry center and the symmetry axis, when they exist. A complexity analysis of the algorithms is also given. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The minimizing problem is addressed in a finite element space through the choice of some semi-norms based on decomposition of the divergence operator and vector fields into a form with a rotational part. We study the existence and the uniqueness of the solution of such a problem. Then, a convergence result and an estimation of the error are established.

Simulation studies are carried out to compare weighted and unweighted least squares methods, the maximum likelihood method and method of moments. This work concludes that least squares methods via weighting factors to estimate the parameters of this probability distribution give a better performance than unweighted least squares methods, showing the importance of weighting factors. Besides, results of this simulation study show that a good performance is obtained using the maximum likelihood method and the estimators obtained with more bias are those of the method of moments.

Simultaneous in-and-out-of-plane displacement measurements using fringe projection and digital image correlation	OPTICS AND LASERS IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Fringe projection; Digital image correlation; Displacement analysis	DEFORMATION MEASUREMENT; SHAPE	The combination of fringe projection (FP) and two-dimensional digital image correlation (2D-DIC) has been proposed in previous work [11 as an alternative method to obtain displacement maps in the three spatial directions. However, if a telecentric lens is not employed in the experimental setup, the in-plane displacements obtained with 2D-DIC are influenced by the out-of-plane displacements occurring during deformation. Nevertheless, this error can be corrected if the out-of-plane displacements are known, for instance from measurements using the FP technique. In this paper a novel methodology based on the combination of FP and 2D-DIC is employed to perform the correction of the in-plane displacements, and is applied to several experimental examples. Results are compared and validated with those obtained using a commercial 3D-DIC system showing an average displacement error of 4% for X-displacements and 6.5% for Y-displacements.

Modeling phase change materials behavior in building applications: Comments on material characterization and model validation	RENEWABLE ENERGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	WREC The World Renewable Energy Congress	MAY 08-13, 2011	Linkoping, SWEDEN			Phase change material; PCM characterization; Mathematical model; Model validation	THERMAL-ENERGY STORAGE; HYPERBRANCHED POLYURETHANE; PCM; COMPOSITES; SIMULATION; CAPSULES; PORES	In a recent meeting of IEA's Annex 23, several members presented their conclusions on the modeling of phase change materials behavior in the context of building applications. These conclusions were in agreement with those of a vast review, involving the survey of more than 250 journal papers, undertaken earlier by the group of Ecole de technologie superieure. In brief, it can be stated that, at this point, the confidence in reviewed models is too low to use them to predict the future behavior of a building with confidence. Moreover, it was found that overall thermal behaviors of phase change material are poorly known, which by itself creates an intrinsic unknown in any model. Models themselves are most of time suspicious as they are often not tested in a very stringent or exhaustive way. In addition, it also appears that modeling parameters are somewhat too simplified to realistically describe the complete physics needed to predict the real life performance of PCMs added to a building. As a result, steps are now taken to create standard model benchmarks that will improve the confidence of the users. Hopefully, following these efforts, confidence will increase and usage of PCM in buildings should be eased. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Wildlife corridors and drainage conduits often fall into this category of partially buried structures. Their dynamic behaviour has received far less attention than that of other structures such as bridges, but their large number makes their study an interesting challenge in order to achieve safe and cost-effective structures. As ballast operations are a key life cycle cost, and excessive vibrations increase the need of ballast regulation in order to ensure track geometry, special attention is paid to accelerations, the values of which should be limited to avoid track instability according to Eurocode. In this paper, the data obtained during on site measurements on culverts belonging to a Spanish high-speed train line are presented. A set of six rectangular-shaped, closed-frame underpasses were monitored under traffic loading. Acceleration records at different points of the structures are presented and discussed. They reveal a non-uniform dynamic response of the roof-slab, with the highest observed values below the occupied track. Also, they indicate that the dynamic response is important up to frequencies higher than those usually observed for standard simply supported bridges. Finally, they are used to obtain a heuristic rule to estimate acceleration levels on the roof-slab.

These methods work in the space of the original measured variables and have performed reasonably well when there is a reduced number of mildly correlated quality and/or process variables with a well-conditioned covariance matrix. These approaches have been introduced by emphasizing their positive or negative virtues, generally on an individual basis, so it is not clear for the practitioner the best method to be used. This article provides a comprehensive study of the performance of diverse methodological approaches when tested on a large number of distinct simulated scenarios. Our primary aim is to highlight key weaknesses and strengths in these methods as well as clarifying their relationships and the requirements for their implementation in practice.

The influence of dolomite and throughput in tar production and composition	FUEL			English	Article						Sewage sludge gasification; Primary measures; Gravimetric tar production; GC-detectable tar	IN-BED USE; FLUIDIZED-BED; BIOMASS GASIFICATION; RAW GAS; GASIFIER; CATALYSTS; OLIVINE; ELIMINATION; VARIABLES; CONVERSION	The influence of throughput (TR), steam and the use of dolomite (as primary catalyst) over the sewage sludge gasification products was investigated. For this purpose, experiments were conducted in an atmospheric fluidised bed reactor using air and air + steam as gasifying agents. The analysis of the results was mainly focussed on the gas composition, the gravimetric tar production, and the GC-detectable tar composition (and dew point estimations). According to the obtained results, higher TRs decreased the H-2 content of the produced gas and clearly increased the gravimetric tar production. The use of air + steam, especially in the presence of dolomite, increased the H-2 content (between 20% and 36%) and decreased the gravimetric tar production over all the tested TR, reaching tar removal efficiencies of up to 71%. Regarding the GC-detectable tar, higher TRs increased the heavy polyaromatic hydrocarbons production, steam slightly increased the water soluble tar content while the use of dolomite decreased the yield of all the tar classes except light aromatic hydrocarbons. Under the tested gasification conditions, the gas dew point never dropped below 110 degrees C, value far above the recommended temperature when the syngas is to be used for engine applications.

The engine performance and exhaust emissions were obtained for both the 5TPL blend and the commercial diesel fuel. Experiments were conducted in four operating modes that simulate the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC). Both brake specific fuel consumption and brake thermal efficiency seemed to be deteriorated by the composition and the properties of the TPL blend at low engine load, while at higher engine load the values of these parameters were almost equal for both fuels. Total hydrocarbon (THC) emissions followed the same pattern than that of the specific fuel consumption since they were higher for 5TPL at low engine load but similar for both fuels when the engine load increased. NOx emissions were higher for 5TPL than those for 100D in three operating modes (U10, EU8 and EU16), while no significant differences were found in the other mode (U9). In addition, 5TPL led to higher smoke opacity respect to those found for 100D in all operating modes. Combustion duration was slightly longer for 5TPL than 100D. This work could be considered as a contribution for strengthening and encouraging the waste tire pyrolysis for the production of liquid fuels which could be used in automotive engines in very limited concentrations.

J	Prieto, F; Sarabia, JM; Saez, AJ				Prieto, Faustino; Maria Sarabia, Jose; Jose Saez, Antonio			Modelling major failures in power grids in the whole range	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER & ENERGY SYSTEMS			English	Article						Electricity transmission networks; Complex Systems; Power law; Pareto II; Lomax; Bootstrap	CASCADING FAILURES; LAW DISTRIBUTIONS; RELIABILITY	Empirical research with electricity transmission networks reliability data shows that the size of major failures - in terms of energy not supplied (ENS), total loss of power (TLP) or restoration time (RT) - appear to follow a power law behaviour in the upper tail of the distribution. However, this pattern (also known as Pareto distribution) is not valid in the whole range of those major events. We aimed to find a probability distribution that we could use to model them, and hypothesized that there is a two-parameter model that fits the pattern of those data well in the entire domain. We considered the major failures produced between 2002 and 2012 in the European power grid; analyzed those reliability indicators: ENS, TLP and RT; fitted six alternative models: Pareto II, Fisk, Lognormal, Pareto, Weibull and Gamma distributions, to the data by maximum likelihood; compared these models by the Bayesian information criterion; tested the goodness-of-fit of those models by a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test method based on bootstrap resampling; and validated them graphically by rank-size plots. We found that Pareto II distribution is, in the case of TLP, an adequate model to describe major events reliability data of power grids in the whole range, and in the case of ENS and RT, is the best choice of the six alternative models analyzed.

J	del Real, AJ; Arce, A; Bordons, C				del Real, Alejandro J.; Arce, Alicia; Bordons, Carlos			Combined environmental and economic dispatch of smart grids using distributed model predictive control	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER & ENERGY SYSTEMS			English	Article						Distributed; MPC; Large-scale networks; Economic dispatch; Smart grid; Energy pricing	GENETIC ALGORITHM; POWER DISPATCH; BEE COLONY; SYSTEM; SEARCH	This paper presents an extended distributed model predictive control (DMPC) framework and its application to a smart grid case study. Specifically, a combined environmental and economic dispatch (EED) problem is formulated and solved, which is a non-trivial multi-objective optimization problem given the high number of agents, information exchanges and constraints associated to large-scale smart grids. In this line, the work proposed herein adopts a distributed Lagrange-based model predictive control with reduced computational demand making use of robust mixed-integer quadratic programming (MIQP) solvers. In addition, the model predictive control (MPC) nature of the framework accounts for renewable resource forecast while physical constraints are included in the formulation. The DMPC is herein extended to calculate market-based on-line energy pricing while minimizing the generation cost and emissions,and to include hard and soft constraints and ramp rate limits. The aforementioned control framework is applied to a smart grid composed of 11 consumer centers, 6 energy storages, 11 generation systems and 31 transmission lines. Simulation results show reductions of generation costs up to 40% when predictions are included in the formulation. Furthermore, the simulation of forecast errors results in up to 8% generation overcost. These results show that DMPC can be considered as an alternative versus other heuristic methods, which do not guarantee an optimal solution to the problem. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This way, these conversions can contribute to the creation of the HVDC SuperGrid, which is one possible option to integrate massive renewable energy sources. With this objective, it is necessary to adapt the AC lines to the requirements of DC. The conversion can be carried out changing the head of the line towers or maintaining the towers structure and just making the minimum changes. This paper presents an analysis of the different configurations available for converting AC lines into DC lines and also includes a new proposal for configuration. Finally, a comparison of the presented configurations, in terms of power increase and losses is included. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Functional characterisation of these bio-films was carried out by determination of some of their physico-chemical properties, such as colour, transparency, oxygen barrier, wettability, dye permeation properties and antibacterial effectiveness against Gram negative and Gram positive bacteria. All films exhibited good performance in terms of optical properties in the CIELab space showing high transparency. Carvacrol was able to reduce CC oxygen permeability and slightly increased the surface hydrophobicity. Dye diffusion experiments were performed to evaluate permeation properties. The diffusion of dye through films revealed that SC was more permeable than CC. The agar diffusion method was used for the evaluation of the films antimicrobial effectiveness against Escherichia cell and Staphylococcus aureus. Both SC and CC edible films with carvacrol showed inhibitory effects on both bacteria. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The system was based on ripe olive juice heated at 121 degrees C for 30 min in a stainless steel tubular reactor. The most potent acrylamide inhibitors were proline and sarcosine, both with inhibition rates of similar to 75% at a 100 mM level. In addition, glycine, ornithine, taurine, and gamma-amino butyric acid were effective (50-65% inhibition) while the rest of the compounds demonstrated weak or non-significant effects. Acrylamide contents in the model system were found to be highly correlated with the corresponding contents in the real product. The kinetic pattern for the formation of acrylamide in the absence and presence of two selected amino acids, added separately or together, was well fitted using a simple logistic function.

Fillets from 190 hake were stored frozen at -10 degrees C, -20 degrees C, -30 degrees C, and -80 degrees C for up to 23, 104, 147, and 150 weeks respectively. Kramer shear resistance was adjusted to zero-order kinetics, whereas WHC was in addition fitted to a first order and to a fractional conversion model. The temperature dependence of (i) the rate of WHC loss and (ii) the instrumental shear resistance increase during frozen storage, both followed an Arrhenius type pattern. A good agreement was found between predicted and observed values for both of them, which indicated their potential usefulness for quality management and the estimation of remaining shelf life.

Fine particle size chestnut flour doughs rheology: Influence of additives	JOURNAL OF FOOD ENGINEERING			English	Article						Chia flour; Gluten-free; Guar gum; HPMC; Hydrocolloids	BREADMAKING PERFORMANCE; BREAD; FORMULATIONS	Mixing properties of chestnut flour with typical particle size distribution of wheat flour, incorporated with chia flour (2.5%, 4.0%, 5.0%, 6.0%, 7.5%, flour basis, f.b.), hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC) and guar gum (0.5%, 1.0%, 1.5%, 2.0%, f.b.) were determined at 30 degrees C using Mixolab (R) apparatus. The rheological characterisation at 30 degrees C was achieved by steady shear rate (0.01-10 s(-1)), oscillatory (1-70 rad s(-1) at 0.1% strain) and creep-recovery (loading of 50 Pa for 60 s) tests. Thermal behaviour of all chestnut flour doughs was also depicted. These rheological properties were significantly modified by the presence of chia flour and hydrocolloids. The values of apparent viscosity at each shear rate as well as the values of storage and loss moduli at each angular frequency decreased with chia flour, HPMC or guar gum addition. Creep-recovery data showed that the addition of chia flour at 6.0% (56.5%), HPMC at 2.0% (63.7%) or guar gum at 2.0% (64.5%) improved significantly the doughs elasticity in comparison to chestnut flour (20.2%). The flow curves and mechanical spectra were successfully fitted using Cross and power models, respectively. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Moreira, R.; Chenlo, F.; Torres, M.

Block freeze-concentration of coffee extract: Effect of freezing and thawing stages on solute recovery and bioactive compounds	JOURNAL OF FOOD ENGINEERING			English	Article						Cryoconcentration; Solute yield; Coffee; Chlorogenic acids; Antioxidant activity	CRYOCONCENTRATION TECHNOLOGY; SUCROSE SOLUTIONS; ICE; CAFFEINE; INDUSTRY; JUICES; SYSTEM; WHEY	Coffee extract was freeze-concentrated using the total block technique. The effects of four parameters were evaluated: the initial coffee mass fraction (5 and 15% w/w), the cooling temperature (-10 and -20 degrees C), the heating temperature (20 and 40 degrees C) and the freezing direction (parallel and counter-flow to the thawing direction). The solid concentration was measured during the thawing stage to quantify the solute recovery and the concentration index for one stage of freeze concentration. The coffee mass fraction, the freezing direction and the cooling temperature significantly influenced the solute recovery. A concentration index between 1 and 23 was obtained in one cycle. The effect of block freeze concentration on the bioactive compound concentration and the antioxidant activity was measured. The coffee bioactive compounds were distributed in proportion to the total solid content in the ice and liquid. Therefore, block freeze concentration is an effective technique to preserve functional properties of coffee extracts. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Moreno, F.

Scanning electron microscopy. X-ray diffraction and magnetic measurements were carried out to investigate morphological, structural, microstructural and magnetic properties changes during the milling process. The interdiffusion of Co and Ni leads to a heterogeneous solid solution with Ni-rich and Co-rich environments after 12 h of milling. The end product is a mixture of a highly disordered structure, fcc-Ni(Co), fcc-Co(Ni) and hcp-Co (Ni) phases having different microstructural and structural parameters. The coercivity, H-c, decreases rapidly up to 3 h of milling to about 58.3 Oe and remains constant on further milling. The saturation magnetization, M-s, value of about 126 emu/g is obtained after 48 h of milling. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Testing the application of the Systems Approach Framework (SAF) for the management of eutrophication in the Ria Formosa	MARINE POLICY			English	Article						Eutrophication; Ria Formosa; Systems Approach Framework; SPICOSA		The SAF (Systems Approach Framework) encompasses the ecological, social and economic components of coastal zones and aims to establish a permanent dialogue between scientists, stakeholders and policy makers working within European coastal zones for developing effective ICZM (Integrated Coastal Zone Management). The objective of the present study is to test the application of the SAF for defining eutrophication management options in the Ria Formosa, Portugal. Stakeholders were identified and the issue of eutrophication was agreed upon. Having defined the virtual system, the conceptual model of the Ria Formosa was developed. The formulation of the conceptual model into a mathematical model representing the ecological, social and economic components of the system is then discussed. The linking variable of the three components within the simulation model, as well as the scenarios to be run are then explored. The role of scientists as facilitators within the deliberation process is discussed, and a format by which the final output package could be disseminated is suggested. This case study demonstrates how the SAF could successfully be applied to the management of eutrophication in the Ria Formosa. It also suggests ways in which this approach may be adapted to address unique coastal systems with specific system characteristics. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Performance of a northwestern Mediterranean bottom trawl fleet: How the integration of landings and VMS data can contribute to the implementation of ecosystem-based fisheries management	MARINE POLICY			English	Article						Fishing fleet management; Mediterranean fisheries; Ecosystem approach; Fishing strategies; Target species dynamics; Bottom trawl	SHRIMP ARISTEUS-ANTENNATUS; GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; MULLUS-BARBATUS; MARINE BIODIVERSITY; CONTINENTAL-SHELF; EUROPEAN HAKE; SEA; FRAMEWORK; HABITATS; EXPLOITATION	The European Union has established a framework to achieve or maintain good environmental status in the marine environment by 2020. The Marine Strategy Framework Directive requires the application of the ecosystem approach to the management of human activities, covering all sectors having an impact on the marine environment. However, fisheries in the Mediterranean are far from a systematic implementation of an ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM). Aiming to address this issue, this study explores the potential of the relationship between daily yield by vessel (landings and income by species) and vessel position (known via vessel monitoring system) as a tool for fleet management. This approach is possible due to the current dynamics of Mediterranean fleets, with vessels returning daily to the harbour where landings are registered as weight and income by vessel. Moreover, vessels of > 15 m total length have been compulsory monitored by VMS since 2005. A bottom trawl fleet that operates in the northwestern Mediterranean was chosen to develop this approach. Different groups of trawlers were identified, which could be linked to the strategies displayed by the fishermen that were mainly driven by the target species dynamics. Accurate knowledge of the fishing targets driving the fleet dynamics and of the fishing strategies at the vessel level (i.e. fishing ground habitat where the fishing pressure is exerted and corresponding landings) are shown to be a feasible tool for fleet management.

Socio-economic quantification of fishing in a European urban area: The case of Vigo	MARINE POLICY			English	Article						Socio-economic impact; Fisheries sector; Vigo	COMMON FISHERIES POLICY; ECONOMIC-IMPACTS; STRUCTURAL POLICY; MARINE ECONOMY; UNION; MANAGEMENT; COMMUNITY; SUBSIDIES; MODELS	General data would seem to indicate that aquaculture and extractive fishing are primary activities with a greater presence in developing and less industrial economies. Despite the scant importance of fishing in the EU (in terms of GDP and employment), it remains a focal point of EU activity by means of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). The CFP establishes measures aimed at supporting fishing, often assuming that it is localized activity in rural, less developed regions. This study looks to quantify the importance and economic and social impact of primary fisheries and aquaculture activities in a European urban region (the area of the Ria of Vigo, in Galicia, Spain) through an exercise based on an input-output approach. The exercise carried out will provide results that imply a total impact that could reach around 7% of the study region's income and employment. From these results it can be concluded that fishing as a primary activity may also be relevant in EU urban areas; therefore, fishery management and support measures within the CFP should bear this differentiated reality in mind.

The instruments applied, mostly DEA (Data Envelopment Analysis) and, to a lesser extent, FDH (Free Disposal Hull), are able to encompass several dimensions of performance, but they also have some disadvantages that might be preventing a wider acceptance. The recently developed order-m and order-alpha partial frontiers overcome some of the disadvantages (they are robust with respect to extreme values and noise, and do not suffer from the well-known curse of dimensionality) while keeping the main virtues of DEA and FDH (they are fully nonparametric). In this article we apply not only the non-convex counterpart of DEA (FDH) but also order-m and order-alpha partial frontiers to a sample of US mutual funds. The results obtained for both order-m and order-alpha are useful, since a full ranking of the mutual funds' performance can be obtained. We merge these methods with the literature on mutual fund performance persistence. By combining the two literatures we derive an algorithm which establishes how the choice of m and a parameters intrinsic to order-m and order-alpha (respectively) relate to the existence of performance persistence and the contrarian effect.

J	Polo, OR; Esteban, S; Cercos, L; Parra, P; Angulo, M				Polo, Oscar R.; Esteban, Segundo; Cercos, Lorenzo; Parra, Pablo; Angulo, Manuel			End-to-end validation process for the INTA-Nanosat-1B Attitude Control System	ACTA ASTRONAUTICA			English	Article						End-to-end validation test; Satellite Attitude Control System; Real-time emulation; Hardware in-the-loop; Component-based software development	MODEL	This paper describes the end-to-end validation process for the Attitude Control Subsystem (ACS) of the satellite INTA-NanoSat-1B (NS-1B). This satellite was launched on July 2009 and it has been fully operative since then. The development of its ACS modules required an exhaustive integration and a system-level validation program. Some of the tests were centred on the validation of the drivers of sensors and actuators and were carried out over the flying model of the satellite. Others, more complex, constituted end-to-end tests where the concurrency of modules, the real-time control requirements and even the well-formedness of the telemetry data were verified. This work presents an incremental and highly automatised way for performing the ACS validation program based on two development suites and an end-to-end validation environment. The validation environment combines a Flat Satellite (FlatSat) configuration and a real-time emulator working in closed-loop. The FlatSat is built using the NS-1B Qualification Model (QM) hardware and it can run a complete version of the on-board software with the ACS modules fully integrated. The real-time emulator, running on an industrial PC, samples the actuation signals and emulates the sensors signals to close the control loop with the FlatSat. This validation environment constitutes a low-cost alternative to the classical three axes tilt table, with the advantage of being easily configured for working under specific orbit conditions, in accordance with any of the selected tests. The approach has been successfully applied to the NS-1B in order to verify different ACS modes under multiple orbit scenarios, providing an exhaustive coverage and reducing the risk of eventual errors during the satellite's lifetime. The strategy was applied also during the validation of the maintenance and reconfiguration procedures required once the satellite was launched. This paper describes in detail the complete ACS validation process that was performed and it shows the most relevant errors detected and fixed during testing. Finally it summarises some of the most significant conclusions. (c) 2013 IAA. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Heat storage and electricity generation in the Moon during the lunar night	ACTA ASTRONAUTICA			English	Article						Moon; Energy; System; Heat collection; Heat storage		One of the biggest challenges of the exploration of the Moon is the survival of the crew and the lunar assets during the lunar night. The environmental conditions on the lunar surface and its cycle, with long periods of darkness, make any long mission in need of specific amounts of heat and electricity to be successful. We have analyzed two different systems to produce heat and electricity on the Moon's surface. The first system consists of Thermal Wadis, sources of thermal power that can be used to supply heat to protect the exploration systems from the extreme cold during periods of darkness. Previous results showed that Wadis can supply enough heat to keep lunar devices such as rovers above their minimum operating temperature (approximately 243 K). The second system studied here is the Thermal Energy Storage (TES), which is able to run a heat engine during the lunar night to produce electricity. When the Sun is shining on the Moon's surface, the system can run the engine directly using the solar power and simultaneously heat a thermal mass. This thermal mass is used as a high temperature source to run the heat engine during the night. We present analytical and numerical calculations for the determination of an appropriate thermal mass for the TES system. (C) 2013 IAA. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The baseline target of MarcoPolo-R is the binary NEA (175706) 1996 FG3, which offers an efficient operational and technical mission profile. A binary target also provides enhanced science return. The choice of a binary target allows several scientific investigations to occur more easily than through a single object, in particular regarding the fascinating geology and geophysics of asteroids. MarcoPolo-R will rendezvous with a primitive, organic-rich NEA, scientifically characterize it at multiple scales, and return a bulk sample to Earth for laboratory analyses. The MarcoPolo-R sample will provide a representative sample from the surface of a known asteroid with known geologic context, and will contribute to the inventory of primitive material that is probably missing from the meteorite collection. The MarcoPolo-R samples will thus contribute to the exploration of the origin of planetary materials and initial stages of habitable planet formation, to the identification and characterization of the organics and volatiles in a primitive asteroid and to the understanding of the unique geomorphology, dynamics and evolution of a binary asteroid that belongs to the Potentially Hazardous Asteroid (PHA) population.

The flexibility and the properties of local analysis of the MR pdf facilitate the location of subpopulations into a given population. In order to do this, two algorithms are provided. The MR model is more flexible in adapting to the different subpopulations than the traditional mixtures. In addition, the problems of identification of mixtures distributions and the label-switching do not appear in the MR pdf context.	[Palacios-Gonzalez, F.; Garcia-Fernandez, R.

Computational intelligence in decision making	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Computational Intelligence; Decision Making		In this preface we stress the relevance of the traditional collaboration between Engineering and any field of Mathematics in order to build intelligent decision-aid tools, as it is illustrated by the twelve papers contained in this Special Issue. These papers, selected by means of a standard peer review process after an open call, offer an interesting variety of models, approaches and techniques, to be applied within different specific problems. Each paper is introduced in this preface and is developed in the subsequent article. Moreover, in this preface we also claim for a more intense collaboration between decision engineers and other fields that study human brain behavior, like Neurology, Psychology, Sociology and Linguistics. Because if we really want to procure intelligent tools for decision aid, we should start by taking the human brain as our first reference, as it is the most efficient machinery we have found in order to deal with complex, uncertain, incomplete and even apparently inconsistent information. We hope that readers will enjoy this Special Issue devoted to Computational Intelligence in Decision Making.

A lexicographical dynamic flow model for relief operations	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Humanitarian Logistics; Distribution models; Multicriteria Dynamic Flow Models	HUMANITARIAN RELIEF; DISASTER RESPONSE; LOGISTICS; OPTIMIZATION; SUPPORT	Emergency management is a highly relevant area of interest in operations research. Currently the area is undergoing widespread development. Furthermore, recent disasters have highlighted the importance of disaster management, in order to alleviate the suffering of vulnerable people and save lives. In this context, the problem of designing plans for the distribution of humanitarian aid according to the preferences of the decision maker is crucial. In this paper, a lexicographical dynamic flow model to solve this problem is presented, extending a previously introduced static flow model. The new model is validated in a realistic case study and a computational study is performed to compare both models, showing how they can be coordinated to improve their overall performance.

J	Javier, TT; Leopoldo, GG; Antonia, RM				Javier, Tamayo-Torres; Leopoldo, Gutierrez-Gutierrez; Antonia, Ruiz-Moreno			The relationship between exploration and exploitation strategies, manufacturing flexibility and organizational learning: An empirical comparison between Non-ISO and ISO certified firms	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Manufacturing flexibility; Exploration; Exploitation; ISO certified; Organizational learning	TOTAL QUALITY MANAGEMENT; RESOURCE-BASED VIEW; DYNAMIC CAPABILITIES; BUSINESS PERFORMANCE; INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY; ISO-9000 CERTIFICATION; COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; PRODUCTIVITY DILEMMA; PERSPECTIVE; AMBIDEXTERITY	The markets in which organizations currently operate require them to use behaviour based on both exploitation strategy and exploration strategy, each of which contributes fundamental benefits for the firm's success. Exploitation strategy attempts to obtain the maximum advantage from existing abilities, whereas exploration strategy searches for new ways for the organization to adapt. Further, since manufacturing markets are characterized by short product life, they require a high level of manufacturing flexibility, which can play a crucial role in the development of the exploitation and exploration strategies. This study analyses the relationship of manufacturing flexibility to exploitation and exploration strategies, taking into account an issue of maximum international scope: the implementation of ISO standards. In many international markets, ISO implementation is crucial in enabling organizations to be competitive. However, no consensus has been reached concerning the real benefits that these systems provide to the organizations that implement them. The main goal of our study is to analyse whether there are significant differences in the relationship of manufacturing flexibility to exploitation and exploration strategies in ISO 9001:2000 certified organizations and non-certified organizations. Our results show that most of the relationships analysed are only significant in ISO certified organizations. As an added value, the study analyses the relationship of exploitation and exploration strategies to organizational learning orientation and finds this relationship to be significant in all cases.

A proportional approach to claims problems with a guaranteed minimum	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Claims problems; Proportional solution; Equal awards; Lorenz dominance	GAME-THEORETIC ANALYSIS; BANKRUPTCY; TALMUD; CONSTRAINTS; RULES	In distribution problems, and specifically in bankruptcy issues, the Proportional (P) and the Egalitarian (EA) divisions are two of the most popular ways to resolve the conflict. Nonetheless, when using the egalitarian division, agents may receive more than her claim. We propose a compromise between the proportional and the egalitarian approaches by considering the restriction that no one receives more than her claim. We show that the most egalitarian compromise fulfilling this restriction ensures a minimum amount to each agent. We also show that this compromise can be interpreted as a process that works in two steps as follows: first, all agents receive an equal share up to the smallest claim if possible (egalitarian distribution), and then, the remaining estate (if any) is allocated proportionally to the remaining claims (proportional distribution). Finally, we obtain that the recursive application of this process finishes at the Constrained Equal Awards solution (CEA). (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Martin-Barragan, B; Lillo, R; Romo, J				Martin-Barragan, Belen; Lillo, Rosa; Romo, Juan			Interpretable support vector machines for functional data	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Data mining; Interpretability; Classification; Linear programming; Regularization methods; Functional data analysis	RULE EXTRACTION; CLASSIFICATION; PREDICTION; SELECTION; LASSO	Support Vector Machines (SVMs) is known to be a powerful nonparametric classification technique even for high-dimensional data. Although predictive ability is important, obtaining an easy-to-interpret classifier is also crucial in many applications. Linear SVM provides a classifier based on a linear score. In the case of functional data, the coefficient function that defines such linear score usually has many irregular oscillations, making it difficult to interpret. This paper presents a new method, called Interpretable Support Vector Machines for Functional Data, that provides an interpretable classifier with high predictive power. Interpretability might be understood in different ways. The proposed method is flexible enough to cope with different notions of interpretability chosen by the user, thus the obtained coefficient function can be sparse, linear-wise, smooth, etc. The usefulness of the proposed method is shown in real applications getting interpretable classifiers with comparable, sometimes better, predictive ability versus classical SVM.

Pluronic-covered oil-water interfaces under simulated duodenal conditions	FOOD HYDROCOLLOIDS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	14th Food Colloids Conference	APR 15-18, 2012	Copenhagen, DENMARK			Pluronic; Lipid digestion; Lipase; Bile salts; Interfacial tension; Dilatational rheology	IN-VITRO DIGESTION; PENETRATION LANGMUIR BALANCE; CONTINUOUS-FLOW TENSIOMETRY; DROP SHAPE-ANALYSIS; TRIBLOCK COPOLYMERS; BLOCK-COPOLYMERS; AIR/WATER INTERFACE; SURFACE-ACTIVITY; BILE-SALTS; F68	An emerging application of colloidal science is the design of foods that provide specific physiological responses, such as control of satiety and delivery of bioactive components to specific locations. Pluronics are known to hinder the access of lipase in the presence of bile salts to the lipid droplets owing to the formation of a steric barrier, thus delaying the rate of lipid digestion. The aim of this work is to advance into the understanding of the impact of Pluronics on lipid digestion. We have partially studied the effect of the lengths of the hydrophobic/hydrophilic chains on in-vitro digestion of interfacial layers of Pluronics adsorbed at the olive oil-water interface. Pluronics F127 and F68 were tested. F127 has a longer hydrophobic chain than F68, providing higher interfacial coverage at the same molar concentration, due to the adsorption of this portion onto the oil-water interface. F127 also has longer hydrophilic chains that remain in the aqueous phase leading to a greater steric bulky layer. F127 and F68 interfacial layers were selected to provide same interfacial tension, related to the interfacial coverage, but differing in the length of the steric bulky layer. The experiments have been carried out in a novel pendant drop film balance developed at the University of Granada (The OCTOPUS), which allows the simulation of the digestion process on a single droplet. A correlation between specific interfacial structure of two Pluronics and digestion rate is obtained from the interfacial response, importantly complementing the behaviour of emulsions found in previous work. The chosen Pluronic adsorbed layers showed similar resistance to lipase activity in the presence of bile salts, indicating the importance of the interfacial tension when controlling lipid digestion rate.

Influence of the microstructure on the bulk and grain boundary conductivity in apatite-type electrolytes	JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES			English	Article						Apatite-type electrolyte; SOFC; Microstructure; Porosity; Impedance spectroscopy	OXIDE FUEL-CELLS; SOL-GEL PROCESS; ION CONDUCTIVITY; ELECTRICAL-PROPERTIES; OXY-APATITE; ELECTRONIC TRANSPORT; LANTHANUM SILICATE; OXYAPATITE POWDERS; CERAMICS; ROUTE	Silicate and germanate apatites have attracted great interest because of their high ionic conductivity for fuel cells and other electrochemical applications. The values of conductivity of these materials are comparable or even higher than those of Zr0.84Y0.16O1.92 (YSZ), but vary depending on the synthetic method used and the level of densification. In order to evaluate the influence of the microstructure on the transport properties of apatite-type electrolytes, La10Si5.5Al0.5O26.75 (LSA) and La9.6Ge5.5Al0.5O26.15 (LGA) ceramics with different porosity and average grain size were prepared by varying the sintering temperature and time. Impedance spectroscopy was used to study separately both the bulk and grain boundary contributions from the overall conductivity. The bulk and grain boundary conductivities of silicates resulted highly dependent on both the porosity and the sintering temperature, on the contrary, the conductivity in germanates is barely affected by the microstructure.

Transport-number determination of a protonic ceramic electrolyte membrane via electrode-polarisation correction with the Gorelov method	JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES			English	Article						Strontium zirconate; Proton conduction; Solid oxide electrolyser cell; Modified electromotive force technique; Transference number; Protonic ceramic fuel cell	EMF-MEASUREMENTS; FUEL-CELL; SOLID-ELECTROLYTE; CONDUCTION; HYDROGEN; OXIDES; PEROVSKITES; RESISTANCE; EFFICIENCY; NEEDS	Analysis of transport numbers is critical for assessing the suitability of an ion-conducting material for a given electrochemical application and the conditions for its employment. In this work, the proton, oxide-ion and electron transport numbers of the candidate protonic ceramic electrolyser and fuel cell material SrZr0.9Y0.1O3-delta (with the addition of 4 mol% ZnO as sintering aid) are measured in wet and dry oxidising atmospheres in the temperature range 700-850 degrees C. The determination of proton transport numbers is analysed in detail, encompassing the suitability of equivalent circuits in different conditions and the inclusion of an external parallel resistance for the correction of electrode-polarisation effects (Gorelov method). It is confirmed that transport numbers are highly inaccurate if no polarisation correction is applied. In dry oxidising conditions oxide-ion transport numbers, to, lie in the range 0.63-0.78. The conductivity in wet oxidising conditions is dominated by protons and an electronic component, with the proton transport number increasing from 0.79 to 0.88 with increasing pH(2)O in the range 1.1 x 10(-3) <= pH(2)O <= 1.27 x 10(-2) atm at 700 degrees C.

The sodium ion conducting electrolytes exhibit excellent ionic conductivities, up to 5.5 mS cm(-1) at room temperature, and a useful thermal window of -86 degrees C to 150 degrees C. In more detail, Raman data analysis supported by DFT calculations on Na+-TFSI complexes, allow us to determine the sodium ion solvation and charge carrier nature as a function of salt concentration. The results are compared to data for the corresponding Li systems and while such electrolytes essentially form [Li(TFSI)(2)](-) as the main Li+ carrier, the sodium systems seem to dominantly form [Na(TFSI)(3)](2-) complexes. The effects on conductivity and viscosity and the consequences for sodium-ion battery implementation are discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The results have shown that the examined separator membranes, particularly those based on the PVdF co-polymers, are able to uptake large liquid amounts leading to high ionic conductivity values. Tests performed on Li/LiFePO4 and Li/Sn-C cells have revealed very good cycling performance even at high current rates and 100% of DOD, approaching the results achieved in liquid electrolytes. A capacity fading lower than 0.002% per cycle was observed. Particularly, the Li/LiFePO4 cathode cells have exhibited excellent rate capability, being still able to deliver at 2C above 89% of the capacity discharged at 0.1C. These results, in conjunction with the about 100% coulombic efficiency, suggest very good electrolyte/electrode compatibility, which results from the high purity and stability of the electrolyte and electrode materials and the cell manufacturing.

Composite hybrid membranes of PBI and the ionic liquid diethlyamine bisulphate/sulfate were fabricated at different composition ratios PBI/xDESH. FTIR spectra showed that the IL did not change the PBI structure. The ionic liquid only weakly interacts with PBI and remains free inside the structure allowing for the observed ionic conduction. PBI/xDESH membranes could operate under a higher temperature values/low humidity conditions with conductivity >0.01 S cm(-1). The measured proton conductivity, from symmetrical H-2 cell, however, is ca. 4 times lower than that of the measured ionic conductivity. This could be estimated roughly by considering proton conduction where the proton is associated with two anions A(-) resulting in ionic agglomerate HA(2-) with more than double the ionic radius of A(-) and consequently less than half of its diffusivity. Additionally, considering the solvation number of that agglomerate to be 1.0 will result not only in a slower proton diffusion and lower conductivity but will also cause serious flooding and mass transport limitation at the cathode. This cumulative effect will limit the life of the cell due to the IL migration from anode and membrane to the cathode. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Optimization of ZnO:Al based back reflectors for applications in thin film flexible solar cells	VACUUM			English	Article						ZnO:Al; Molybdenum; Sputtering; NH4Cl etching; Scattering capability; Flexible solar cells	OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; AL FILMS; PERFORMANCES	Back reflectors based on Aluminum and Molybdenum as the reflecting materials and ZnO:Al as the transparent conductive oxide, were deposited at low temperature on polyethylene naphthalate by magnetron sputtering. The optimization of the layer thickness of the constituent materials and the final texture of the structure was performed in order to achieve structures with appropriate properties to be applied to amorphous silicon solar cells. In this sense, average total reflectance values of 71% in the wavelength range of 400-800 nm were obtained for the layer stack of 80 nm-thick ZnO:Al layer on 235 nm-thick Aluminum deposited directly on the flexible substrate. However, this structure showed a poor adherence onto the substrate. This issue was improved using a thin Molybdenum layer between the metal and the substrate, maintaining similar optical properties. On the other hand, textured back reflectors were obtained etching the transparent conductive oxide with NH4Cl aqueous solution. After the etching process, the highest enhancement was achieved for the sample that used an Mo/Al bilayer as reflective metal. In this case, a roughness of around 29 nm and a haze factor of 25% at 600 nm were achieved. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Fernandez, S.; Bollero, A.; Gandia, J.

Ontology Based Road Traffic Management in Emergency Situations	AD HOC & SENSOR WIRELESS NETWORKS			English	Article						VANET; traffic management; decision; ontology; emergency		Every time an exceptional situation takes place on the road, dangerous situations occur and they need the drivers' skills in order to cope with them. These special situations can occur due to many reasons such as a non-expected object on the road, or an incoming emergency vehicle. Current proposals consider that vehicles are equipped with sensors and communication devices that collect and communicate sensor data to a central point to take further decisions. In this paper, those exceptional situations are handled in a different way: we propose to integrate an ontology inside each vehicle to provide them with distributed reasoning capabilities. Our system benefits traffic management in emergency situations with immediate and coherent suggestions to drivers where each vehicle is a decision point, reacts considering its neighboring vehicles, and collaborates with them to reach consensus in real time. A complete analysis of the system is given, from the behavior of the wireless link channel to the application level, giving an integral description of the designed solution. The system operates continuously adapting itself to driver reactions. A common ontology provides, during the reasoning process, a suggestion to each driver, maintaining the coherence of the whole set of suggestions (avoiding conflicting situations).	[Bermejo, A.

Rather strikingly, there are ranges of values of the parameters involved in its setting for which the model admits an arbitrarily large number of positive solutions, as a result of their fast oscillatory behavior, for sufficiently large M. Further, using the amplitude of the superlinear term as the main bifurcation parameter, we can ascertain the global bifurcation diagram of the positive solutions. This seems to be the first work where these multiplicity results have been documented.

ASYMPTOTIC BEHAVIOUR OF THE NONAUTONOMOUS SIR EQUATIONS WITH DIFFUSION	COMMUNICATIONS ON PURE AND APPLIED ANALYSIS			English	Article						SIR epidemic model with diffusion; nonautonomous dynamical systems; nonautonomous equilibria; asymptotic stability; pullback attractors; asymptotic compactness; flattening property	PULLBACK ATTRACTORS; DIFFERENTIAL-EQUATIONS; DYNAMICAL-SYSTEMS; EPIDEMIC MODEL; PERSISTENCE; SEMIFLOWS; BIOLOGY	The existence and uniqueness of positive solutions of a nonautonomous system of SIR equations with diffusion are established as well as the continuous dependence of such solutions on initial data. The proofs are facilitated by the fact that the nonlinear coefficients satisfy a global Lipschitz property due to their special structure. An explicit disease-free nonautonomous equilibrium solution is determined and its stability investigated. Uniform weak disease persistence is also shown. The main aim of the paper is to establish the existence of a nonautonomous pullback attractor is established for the nonautonomous process generated by the equations on the positive cone of an appropriate function space. For this an energy method is used to determine a pullback absorbing set and then the flattening property is verified, thus giving the required asymptotic compactness of the process.

In this case, the operator that appears is the Bessel Laplacian and the solution u(t, x) is given in terms of a Fourier-Bessel expansion. We prove that, for initial L-p data, the series converges in the L-2 norm. The analysis of a particular operator, the adjoint of the Riesz transform for Fourier-Bessel series, is needed for our purposes, and may be of independent interest.

Fractal dimension for fractal structures: A Hausdorff approach revisited	JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Fractal; Fractal structure; Generalized fractal space; Fractal dimension; Box-counting dimension; Hausdorff measure; Hausdorff dimension	SYSTEMS	In this paper, we use fractal structures to study a new approach to the Hausdorff dimension from both continuous and discrete points of view. We show that it is possible to generalize the Hausdorff dimension in the context of Euclidean spaces equipped with their natural fractal structure. To do this, we provide three definitions of fractal dimension for a fractal structure and study their relationships and mathematical properties. One of these definitions is in terms of finite coverings by elements of the fractal structure. We prove that this dimension is equal to the Hausdorff dimension for compact subsets of Euclidean spaces. This may be the key for the creation of new algorithms to calculate the Hausdorff dimension of these kinds of space. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Equivariant Willmore surfaces in conformal homogeneous three spaces	JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Equivariant Willmore surface; Homogeneous 3-space; Riemannian submersion; Bundle-like conformal metric; Elastic curve; Berger sphere; Heisenberg manifold	MEAN-CURVATURE; CURVES; TORI; REVOLUTION; CHEN	The complete classification of homogeneous three spaces is well known for some time. Of special interest are those with rigidity four which appear as Riemannian submersions with geodesic fibres over surfaces with constant curvature. Consequently their geometries are completely encoded in two values, the constant curvature, c, of the base space and the so called bundle curvature, r. In this paper, we obtain the complete classification of equivariant Willmore surfaces in homogeneous three spaces with rigidity four. All these surfaces appear by lifting elastic curves of the base space. Once more, the qualitative behaviour of these surfaces is encoded in the above mentioned parameters (c, r). The case where the fibres are compact is obtained as a special case of a more general result that works, via the principle of symmetric criticality, for bundle-like conformal structures in circle bundles. However, if the fibres are not compact, a different approach is necessary. We compute the differential equation satisfied by the equivariant Willmore surfaces in conformal homogeneous spaces with rigidity of order four and then we reduce directly the symmetry to obtain the Euler Lagrange equation of 4r(2)-elasticae in surfaces with constant curvature, c. We also work out the solving natural equations and the closed curve problem for elasticae in surfaces with constant curvature. It allows us to give explicit parametrizations of Willmore surfaces and Willmore tori in those conformal homogeneous 3-spaces. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AC Power Losses Model for Planar Windings With Rectangular Cross-Sectional Conductors	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER ELECTRONICS			English	Article						Electromagnetic modeling; frequency-dependent impedance; passive components; printed circuits	TRANSFORMER WINDINGS; INTERNAL IMPEDANCE; WAVE-FORMS; APPLIANCES; RESISTANCE	In this letter, a method to calculate the ac losses, including skin effect and proximity losses, in planar windings with rectangular cross-sectional conductors is proposed. The aim is proposing proper ac losses expressions similar to the formulas available for round cross-sectional wires, to be used for the calculation of the ac losses and the optimization of planar magnetic windings implemented in the printed circuit board. The proposed model is based on the decomposition into conduction and proximity losses. Conduction losses only depend on the properties of the conductor, whereas proximity losses are calculated by using the orthogonal decomposition of the magnetic fields in which the conductors are immersed.

J	Sebastian, J; Fernandez-Miaja, P; Rodriguez, A; Rodriguez, M				Sebastian, Javier; Fernandez-Miaja, Pablo; Rodriguez, Alberto; Rodriguez, Miguel			Analysis and Design of the Output Filter for Buck Envelope Amplifiers	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER ELECTRONICS			English	Article						DC-DC power converters; harmonic filters; power conversion harmonics; pulse width modulation converters; radio-frequency amplifiers	RF POWER-AMPLIFIER; TRACKING APPLICATIONS; SUPPLY VOLTAGE; CONVERTER; BANDWIDTH; TRANSMITTER; ELIMINATION	The efficiency of linear power amplifiers can be improved by modulating its supply voltage according to the peak value of the signal that is being amplified in a technique usually known as envelope tracking. High bandwidth dc/dc converters called envelope amplifiers (EAs) are used to carry out the supply modulation in an efficient manner. In the case of linear RF power amplifiers, the bandwidth requirements over the EA strongly depend on the signal being amplified: in modern telecommunication applications it can range from several hundred kilohhertzs to a few tens of megahertz. The path to achieve such bandwidths usually goes through increased switching frequencies and/or reduced ratio of switching frequency to converter bandwidth. However, these may lead to lower converter efficiency and increased distortion, making the design of EAs a challenging task. This paper addresses the analysis and design of the output filter for Buck converters operating as EA. The output filter must provide enough attenuation at the switching frequency and harmonics to guarantee a desired level of distortion while enabling tracking of wide-bandwidth envelope signals with high converter efficiency. This paper focuses on the use of high-order filters (up to sixth-order Bessel-Thomson, Butterworth, and Legendre-Papoulis filters) in a buck dc/dc converter working as an EA. The filters are analytically described and characterized, and a design procedure that takes into account the major design constraints is proposed, allowing the selection of the appropriate filter for a given application. The proposed analysis and design method are supported by simulation results, as well as by experiments obtained using a 1 MHz buck converter operating as an EA.

New contributions to granite characterization by ultrasonic testing	ULTRASONICS			English	Article						Granite characterization; Nondestructive testing; Ultrasonic testing; Mechanical properties; Fast Fourier Transform	VELOCITY; ROCKS; WAVES	Ultrasound evaluation permits the state of rocks to be determined quickly and cheaply, satisfying the demands faced by today's producers of ornamental stone, such as environmental sustainability, durability and safety of use. The basic objective of the present work is to analyse and develop the usefulness of ultrasound testing in estimating the physico-mechanical properties of granite. Various parameters related to Fast Fourier Transform (FFTs) and attenuation have been extracted from some of the studies conducted (parameters which have not previously been considered in work on this topic, unlike the ultrasonic pulse velocity). The experimental study was carried out on cubic specimens of 30 cm edges using longitudinal and shear wave transducers and equipment which extended the normally used natural resonance frequency range up to 500 kHz. Additionally, a validation study of the laboratory data has been conducted and some methodological improvements have been implemented. The main contribution of the work is the analysis of linear statistical correlations between the aforementioned new ultrasound parameters and physico-mechanical properties of the granites that had not previously been studied, i.e., resistance to salt crystallization and breaking load for anchors. Being properties that directly affect the durability and safety of use of granites, these correlations consolidate ultrasonics as a nondestructive method well suited to this type of material.

These multiphase machines are usually modeled by a reference frame transformation to avoid the cross-coupling of variables. This transformation decomposes the original n-dimensional vector space into orthogonal subspaces. Mapping the voltage and current harmonics into the subspaces in distributed machines is important because it allows to identify which components are related to the torque and which ones just increase the machine losses. The sequence identification of each harmonic is also important in closed-loop current harmonic compensation to set the controllers. In addition, the harmonic mapping is interesting in multimotor systems to know how harmonics from one machine can affect the other machines in the system. In this paper, a simple graphical method for time harmonic subspace and sequence identification is proposed. This method is valid for symmetrical machines of any phase number n, it provides full subspace and sequence identification and it can be used in multimotor systems. Experimental results using a five-and a six-phase motor in single-drive configuration and a series-connected two-motor six-phase drive validate the proposed method.

SVM Procedure for n-Phase VSI With Low Harmonic Distortion in the Overmodulation Region	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS			English	Article						Multiphase; overmodulation; space vector pulse width modulation	SPACE VECTOR PWM	Space vector modulation (SVM) technique has become a standard method for the impression of voltage references in conventional three-phase voltage source inverters. The method is nowadays used in multiphase (more than three) drives, where linear and overmodulation regions are covered only for the five-phase case. This work proposes a general SVM procedure for linear and overmodulation regions in n-phase drives (being n any odd number, n > 3) and simplifies the extension of SVM to the multiphase case. The proposed method achieves the reference voltage at the fundamental frequency while reducing introduced harmonic components in the overmodulation region compared to previous proposals.

In the studied topology, an asymmetrical six-phase induction machine is controlled using two three-phase two-level voltage source converters connected in series to form a cascaded dc link. The suggested configuration is analyzed, and a method for dc-link midpoint voltage balancing is developed. Voltage balancing is based on the use of additional degrees of freedom that exist in multiphase machines and represents entirely new utilization of these degrees. The validity of the topology and its control is verified by simulation and experimental results on a laboratory-scale prototype, thus proving that it is possible to achieve satisfactory dc-link voltage control under various operating scenarios.

The VF space vector is utilized in transformations between stationary and rotating coordinates in VFOC and in obtaining instantaneous power in VF-DPC. The VF space vector is calculated by integrating the grid voltage space vector. This integration is usually performed using a first-order low-pass (LP) (FOLP) filter, which counteracts the saturation and dc-drift problems associated with pure integrators. However, the dynamics of FOLP filters can be enhanced to a great extent. This paper presents a new, simple, and fast integration algorithm for VF-based control methods. Simulations and experimental tests on a VF-DPC-based system showed that the proposed algorithm leads to rapid recoveries after grid voltage sags occur. Moreover, the performance of VF-DPC under nonideal grids is discussed.

As a particular situation, we shall consider the case where the equation is driven by a fractional Brownian motion B-H with Hurst parameter H > 1/2. In contrast to the article by Maslowski and Nualart [71], we present here an existence and uniqueness result in the space of Holder continuous functions with values in a Hilbert space V. If the initial condition is in the latter space this forces us to consider solutions in a different space, which is a generalization of the Holder continuous functions. That space of functions is appropriate to introduce a non-autonomous dynamical system generated by the corresponding solution to the equation. In fact, when choosing B-H as the driving process, we shall prove that the dynamical system will turn out to be a random dynamical system, defined over the ergodic metric dynamical system generated by the infinite dimensional fractional Brownian motion.

Actually we prove that under suitable assumptions, and thanks to regularity results, the attraction also happens in the H-1 norm for arbitrarily large finite intervals of time. Indeed, from comparison results of attractors we establish that all these families of attractors are in fact the same object. The tempered character of these families in H-1 is also analyzed.

PULLBACK ATTRACTORS FOR THE NON-AUTONOMOUS 2D NAVIER STOKES EQUATIONS FOR MINIMALLY REGULAR FORCING	DISCRETE AND CONTINUOUS DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						2D Navier-Stokes equations; pullback attractors; pullback flattening property; compact absorbing set	2D-NAVIER-STOKES EQUATIONS; INERTIAL MANIFOLDS; UNBOUNDED-DOMAINS; DYNAMICAL-SYSTEMS; EXISTENCE	This paper treats the existence of pullback attractors for the non-autonomous 2D Navier-Stokes equations in two different spaces, namely L-2 and H-1. The non-autonomous forcing term is taken in L-loc(2)(R; H-1) and L-loc(2)(R; L-2) respectively for these two results: even in the autonomous case it is not straightforward to show the required asymptotic compactness of the flow with this regularity of the forcing term. Here we prove the asymptotic compactness of the corresponding processes by verifying the flattening property - also known as "Condition (C)". We also show, using the semigroup method, that a little additional regularity - f is an element of L-loc(p)(R; H-1) or f is an element of L-loc(p)(R; L-2) for some p > 2 - is enough to ensure the existence of a compact pullback absorbing family (not only asymptotic compactness). Even in the autonomous case the existence of a compact absorbing set for this model is new when f has such limited regularity.
