Isolation of Rickettsia massiliae from Rhipicephalus sanguineus Ticks, Buenos Aires (Argentina)	JOURNAL OF PARASITOLOGY			English	Article							SPOTTED-FEVER; DOGS; BRAZIL	Rickettsia massiliae, a member of the spotted fever group of Rickettsia, was first isolated from a Rhipicephalus turanicus tick in France. In the New World, it has been detected in Rhipicephalus sanguineus ticks from different geographical locations in Argentina and the United States, but it has only been isolated in Arizona. The aim of this study was the isolation and genetic characterization of R. massiliae from R. sanguineus ticks collected from dogs in Buenos Aires city, Argentina. In total, 49 R. sanguineus ticks were collected from 10 dogs and grouped into 10 pools of 4-5 specimens. With a PCR assay, which detects a fragment of the Rickettsia genus-specific 23S-5S intergenic space, 1 pool of 5 ticks was found positive. Generated sequences exhibited 100% identity with R. massiliae. A new isolate, named CABA, was obtained from this pool by inoculating it into monolayers of Vero cells. Genotypic characteristics were determined, and results showed that fragments of the 23S-5S intergenic space, ompA, ompB, gltA, htrA, and sca1 genes had great similarity with R. massiliae strain Bar29 (Spain). Although few human cases have been confirmed for this pathogen, its circulation in urban areas is of great importance to public health. This isolation improves knowledge of the circulating pathogen and could improve future diagnostic processes as it allows the production of more specific antigens for serological testing.

The role of Argopecten purpuratus shells structuring the soft bottom community in shallow waters of southern Peru	JOURNAL OF SEA RESEARCH			English	Article						Ecosystem engineering; Argopecten purpuratus; Macrobenthos; Shells; El Nino; Peru	INTERMEDIATE DISTURBANCE HYPOTHESIS; ECOSYSTEM ENGINEERS; EL-NINO; UPWELLING SYSTEM; HABITAT; BAY; DIVERSITY; RECRUITMENT; CRAB; BEDS	Accumulation of Argopecten purpuratus shells often occurs after El Nino events in shallow waters of Independencia Bay (14 degrees 17'S-76 degrees 10'W; Pisco, Peru). Here we experimentally investigate the effects of their shell accumulation on macrobenthos assemblages in soft bottom, shallow areas of the bay. A field experiment (from May 2006 to May 2007), including four treatments with different coverage levels of empty shells of A. purpuratus, were randomly arranged in: (1) areas devoid of shells ("Empty" treatment: experimental control), (2) 50% of the plot area covered with shells haphazardly distributed over the bottom ("medium" treatment), (3) 100% of the plot area covered with shells, forming a 10 cm valve layer ("full" treatment) and (4) "natural control". We found a total of 124 taxa throughout the experiment. Polychaetes, crustaceans and mollusks were the most abundant groups in "natural controls", dominated by the gastropod Nassarius gayi and the polychaetes Prionospio peruana, Platynereis bicanaliculata and Mediomastus branchiferus. The abundance of individuals (N) and the species richness (S) were higher in the "medium" treatment, but only in one month under positive sea bottom thermal anomalies. Similarity analysis (Bray-Curtis) showed that "natural control", "empty" and "full" treatments were more similar among them than the "medium" treatment. Multidimensional analysis showed no clear species association among treatments and a higher grouping among the samplings of Jun-06, Aug-06 and Nov-06. Our results also showed that the commercial crab Romaleon polyodon and the polyplacophora Tonicia elegans were positively affected by shell accumulations ("medium" treatment), while the limpet Fissurella crassa was negatively affected. Our study shows that directly by changing habitat structure or indirectly by changing sediment characteristics, the addition of scallop shells to the soft bottom can modify the macrobenthic assemblage; however, the seasonal oceanographic variability (e.g. upwelling, El Nino) could have stronger effects controlling this system than the presence of the shells itself.

However, a high mortality of calves has been observed in the last years, which could be associated with phycotoxin exposure. During a sampling program conducted late in the calving seasons of 2004, 2005 and 2010, potentially toxic species of the genus Pseudo-nitzschia were observed to be an important component of the phytoplankton community and they were also found in fecal samples of two live whales and three stranded whales. In line with this, in the present study Pseudo-nitzschia australis, Pseudo-nitzschia fraudulenta, Pseudo-nitzschia pungens and the complex Pseudo-nitzschia pseudodelicatissima were identified in fecal samples and phytoplankton samples by light and electron microscopy. Although no toxin analysis was carried out in the present study, our findings suggest that E. australis could be exposed to domoic add in their calving ground. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

During 2007, we sampled the following stations where the trawling exerted could be precisely determined: 11 locations subjected to continuous fishing effort between 1996 and 2006 (continuous fishing effort, 878 commercial tows) and 12 locations subjected to fishing effort between 1996 and 2002 (interrupted fishing effort, 302 commercial tows). Univariate (species richness, Shannon's diversity index, and Pielou's equitability index) and multivariate analysis, analysis of variance, and Kruskal-Wallis tests were applied to analyze species composition and biomass. This study reflects the significant higher density of sessile taxa (Porifera and the ascidean Paramolgula gregaria) and two small ophiuroids (Ophiacantha vivipara and Ophiura lymani), all of them conspicuous during the exploratory cruises conducted in 1995, in the sites where fishing effort was interrupted 4 y before the sampling in 2007 than in those sites continuously exploited and discusses the results considering previous knowledge on the damage that the process on board scallopers imparts on invertebrates bycatch.

INFLUENCE OF GRAIN SIZE ON BURROWING AND ALONGSHORE DISTRIBUTION OF THE YELLOW CLAM (AMARILLADESMA MACTROIDES)	JOURNAL OF SHELLFISH RESEARCH			English	Article						Mesodesmatidae; clam; burrowing; distribution; grain size; sandy beaches; Amarilladesma mactroides	EMERITA-ANALOGA STIMPSON; EXPOSED SANDY BEACHES; 2 CIROLANID ISOPODS; MESODESMA-MACTROIDES; BEHAVIORAL-RESPONSES; MASS MORTALITY; ARGENTINA; BIVALVES; SOUTH; POPULATION	The yellow clam Amarilladesma mactroides (Reeve, 1854), is an intertidal species that prospers mainly on dissipative sandy beaches along the temperate Atlantic coast of South America, from Brazil to Argentina (24-41 degrees S). This large clam is considered a fast burrower, which lives buried in the sediment, migrating seasonally into the intertidal zone. The present study explores the effect of sediment grain size on the burrowing performance of this species, to elucidate the influence of granulometry on the alongshore distribution of the A. mactroides population. Laboratory trials were performed with clams of different sizes, to study the influence of grain size on the burial rate. Clam distribution was analyzed along a 32 km coastal fringe whose granulometric composition varies from very fine to coarse sand. The values of the mean burrowing rate index, a measurement of clam mobility, suggest that burrowing is fast to very fast in fine and medium sand and becomes slower toward areas with extreme particle size (very fine and coarse sand). The burial time of A. mactroides was positively correlated with shell length: small animals can burrow into substrates that may exclude larger animals. Adults clams burrowed in a very limited range of sand grain sizes. They displayed fastest burial times in grain sizes typical of dissipative beaches, i.e., fine to medium sand. Patchy distribution and density variation of A. mactroides alongshore reflect the relation between grain size and burrowing performance: the population is absent in sites with the highest proportion of coarse sands, its density increases in patches with the highest proportion of fine and medium sand and peaks at a site with the highest proportion of fine sand. Results indicate that the discontinuous distribution of A. mactroides along its range could be due to a postsettlement process. Clams can potentially recruit on a wide morphodynamic range, but only may thrive in beaches which sand grain size allows them a rapid reburial during migratory and local movements.

These toxins can accumulate in filter-feeding shellfish and cause diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP). Between 2009 and 2011 the two most frequent and abundant Dinophysis species found in North Patagonian gulfs were Dinophysis tripos Gourret and Dinophysis acuminata Claparede and Lachmann, and in 2015 D. tripos was the only toxic species found in moderate to high relative abundances when mouse bioassay results for DSP were positive. The positive results from mouse bioassay for DSP agree with moderate to high relative abundances of D. tripos and it was the only potentially toxic Dinophysis species found in the samples. The toxin profiles consisted mainly of pectentoxin-2 (PTX-2) followed by PTX-11 and PTX-2 seco acid. The toxin profiles of the samples could be associated with D. tripos, because the maximum proportion of D. acuminata did not exceed 1.3% of total Dinophysis cells in any of the samples. The results suggest that shellfish accumulated high levels of PTX when D. tripos was at a high abundance. To our knowledge, this is the first record of positive results in the mouse bioassay for DSP related to D. tripos and with closures of shellfish harvesting in North Patagonian gulfs.

We hypothesised that the invasive species is able to alter the nitrogen uptake of native plant species, and can modify community functioning. This study was performed under field conditions in the Magellanic Steppe (Argentina). We compared stable isotope signatures, nutrient content and several functional physiological traits in four grassland species with and without H. pilosella interference. We found significant interference effects from the invasive species on native species, mostly through changes in nitrogen uptake. The variation in the natural abundance of foliar delta N-15 suggests that the native plants switched nitrogen sources due to interference with the exotic species. A linear relationship between chlorophyll and proline content that disappears when species are under H. pilosella interference, suggests major changes in the N allocation of native species. Grassland species under interference with exotic species exhibit lower photochemical efficiency and higher water use efficiency. Canonical discriminant analysis evidenced the existence of a different set of functional traits between invasive and native plants, and also among native species with and without H. pilosella interference. Our results support the hypothesis that H. pilosella exerts intense interference with native species through shifting the N sources available for native species, a lower leaf N content, and increasing water stress.

Here we describe the activity of AsES in the plant-pathogen system Arabidopsis thaliana-Botrytis cinerea. We show that AsES renders A. thaliana plants resistant to the necrotrophic pathogen B. cinerea, both locally and systemically and the defense response observed is dose-dependent. Systemic, but not local resistance is dependent on the length of exposure to AsES. The germination of the spores in vitro was not inhibited by AsES, implying that protection to B. cinerea is due to the induction of the plant defenses. These results were further supported by the findings that AsES differentially affects mutants impaired in the response to salicylic acid, jasmonic acid and ethylene, suggesting that AsES triggers the defense response through these three signaling pathways.

The Sentinel-2 mission has the optimal capacity for regional to global agriculture monitoring in terms of resolution (10-20 meter), revisit frequency (five days) and coverage (global). In this context, the European Space Agency launched in 2014 the "Sentinel-2 for Agriculture" project, which aims to prepare the exploitation of Sentinel-2 data for agriculture monitoring through the development of open source processing chains for relevant products. The project generated an unprecedented dataset, made of Sentinel-2 like time series and in situ data acquired in 2013 over 12 globally distributed sites. Earth Observation time series were mostly built on the SPOT4 (Take 5) data set, which was specifically designed to simulate Sentinel-2. They also included Landsat 8 and RapidEye imagery as complementary data sources. Images were pre-processed to Level 2A and the quality of the resulting time series was assessed. In situ data about cropland, crop type and biophysical variables were shared by site managers, most of them belonging to the Joint Experiment for Crop Assessment and Monitoring network. This data set allowed testing and comparing across sites the methodologies that will be at the core of the future "Sentinel-2 for Agriculture" system.

Five-day SC cultures were treated with MEHP (200 mu M) for 24 h and compared to cells in basal conditions. Western blot and immunofluorescent (IF) analyses showed that MEHP induced increase of N-cadherin and catenin expression, modifying its distribution. Concomitantly, Cx-43 expression decreased significantly and delocalization of the IF signal for tight junction proteins (occludin, claudin-11 and ZO-1) occurred. Indicative of oxidative stress, MEHP induced in SC an increase of lipoperoxides, a decrease in glutathione (GSH) levels and a concomitant increase in Glutathione S-Transferases (GST) activity. Antioxidant N-acetyl-cysteine (1 mM) treatment prevented GSH decrease and N-cadherin and alpha-catenin up-regulation induced by MEHP. Our data suggest that oxidative stress signaling is a mechanism involved in adherent cell junctions disruption induced by MEHP in SC cultures. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Revised catalog of Sphingidae from Argentina, with six new records (Lepidoptera: Sphingidae)	SHILAP-REVISTA DE LEPIDOPTEROLOGIA			Spanish	Article						Lepidoptera; Sphingidae; checklist; new records; Tucuman; Argentina		A revised and updated catalogue of 123 species of Sphingidae from Argentina is presented. It has been compiled based on bibliographic, references, specimens in both public and private collections and information known by the author. Six new species are recorded for the country that had not previously published records (Manduca boliviana (B. P. Clark, 1923), M. brasiliensis (Jordan, 1911), M. prestoni (Gehlen, 1926), Nyceryx furtadoi Haxaire, 1996, Perigonia lusca (Fabricius, 1777) and Eumorpha megaeacus (Hubner, [1819])), which are illustrated. New provinces are added to the geographic range of several species. By contrast some species mentioned long ago but not found in collections or collected since then are removed from the list and in other cases there is at least a discussion about their presence in the country. The presence of Manduca schausi (B. P. Clark, 1919), Callionima guiarti (Debauche, 1934) and Nyceryx continua (Walker, 1856) with argentinean specimens in both national and foreign collection is confirmed.

Droughts can affect a wide range of socio-economic sectors while the related direct and indirect impacts are often difficult to quantify. In this context, drought damage refers to the total or partial destruction of physical assets in the affected area. The main constraint in constructing a robust relationship between the severity of drought events and related damages is the lack of sufficient quantitative impact data. In this paper we propose the use of power-law damage functions to assess the relationship between drought severity and related damages in two economic sectors, namely cereal crop production and hydropower generation, across 21 European countries. The different shapes of the resulting damage functions can be explained by the specific drought vulnerability or adaptive capacity of each sector and country. Due to the scarcity of impact data linked to extreme climate events a bootstrap resampling was performed to assess the potential uncertainties associated with the sample size. This approach helps communicating potential drought impacts and related uncertainties to end users and policy makers in support to the development of drought management plans and long-term adaptation measures.

It was the year of the second Rio Summit on Sustainable Development, a huge number of species had been made extinct and conservationists were making increasingly urgent calls for the protection of biodiversity. The situation is ever more critical. Since we started the issue more species have become extinct, and hundreds more have now become critically endangered. The focus issue highlighted the complexity of the links of biodiversity and health, and provides more evidence for the importance to human health of biodiversity on our planet. Research papers contrasted anthropocentric western scientific views of biodiversity and its ecosystem service to humans, with the more horizontal conceptions of indigenous communities in the Amazon-and as many cultures have recognized throughout history, they recognize that we are part of nature: nature does not exist for us.

The chemical structure of the copolymers was confirmed by FTIR and solid-state C-13 NMR and the grafting extent by H-1 NMR and gravimetric analysis. In general, the higher the dose, the smaller the grafting due to the more significant NiPAAm homopolymerization. Due to the grafting of poly(NiPAAm) blocks, aqueous solutions of the different copolymers underwent a sharp transition upon heating above 32 degrees C, the characteristic lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of poly(NiPAAm). Then, the critical micellar concentration (CMC), the size and size distribution and the zeta-potential were characterized by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and the polymeric micelles visualized in suspension and quantified by Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA), at 37 degrees C. CMC values were in the 0.0012-0.0025% w/v range and micelles displayed sizes between 99 and 203 nm with low polydispersity (<0.160) and highly positive zeta-potential (>+15 mV) that suggested the partial conservation of the amine groups upon NiPAAm grafting. Consequently, polymeric micelles displayed the intrinsic mucoadhesiveness of CS, as established in vitro by the mucin solution assay. Finally, the encapsulation capacity of the micelles was assessed with the highly hydrophobic protease inhibitor antiretroviral indinavir free base (IDV. Polymeric micelles led to a significant 24-fold increase of the aqueous solubility from 63 mu g/mL to 1.45 mu g/mL, a performance remarkably better than different poly(ethylene oxide)-b-poly(propylene oxide) block copolymers assessed before. Overall results highlight the potential of this nanotechnology platform to expand the application of polymeric micelles to mucosal administration routes. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Standard short-term treatment includes the oral administration of a combination of "first-line" drugs. However, poor-patient compliance and adherence to the long-term treatments represent one of the mayor drawbacks of the TB therapy. An alternative to the oral route is the pulmonary delivery of anti-TB drugs for local or systemic administration. Nanotechnology offers an attractive platform to develop novel inhalable/respirable nanocarriers. The present investigation was focused on the encapsulation of rifampicin (RIF) (a "first-line" anti-TB drug) within nanopolymersomes (nanoPS) employing di- and tri-block poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) based copolymers as biomaterials. The derivatives presented a number-average molecular weight between 12.2 KDa and 30.1 KDa and a hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance between 0.56 and 0.99. The nanoPS were able to enhance the apparent RIF aqueous solubility (up to 4.62 mg/mL) where the hydrodynamic diameters of the drug-loaded systems (1% w/v) were ranged between 65.8 nm and 94 nm at day 0 as determined by dynamic light scattering (DES). Then, RIF-loaded systems demonstrated as excellent colloidal stability in aqueous media over 14 days with a spherical morphology as determined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Furthermore, RIF-loaded nano-sized PS promoted drug accumulation in macrophages (RAW 264.7) versus a drug solution representing promising results for a potential TB inhaled therapy.

PEG-induced molecular crowding leads to a relaxed conformation, higher thermal stability and lower catalytic efficiency of Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase	COLLOIDS AND SURFACES B-BIOINTERFACES			English	Article						PEG-induced molecular crowding; Enzymatic activity; Protein structure; Thermal stability; Water activity	DYNAMICS; WATER	Enzymatic activities were historically assayed in dilute solutions where molecular crowding, molecular confinement and their consequences were not taken into account. Here we report how macromolecular crowding tunes catalytic parameters for the tetrameric beta-Galactosidase from Escherichia coli, beta-Gal. We detected increases in K-M (weaker substrate binding) and a nonlinear variation in V-max, with a minimum at 25% W/P of the crowding agent (polyethyleneglycol molecular mass 6000, PEG(6000)) resulting in a linear decrease in the catalytic efficiency (k(cat)/K-M) within the whole [PEG(6000)] range tested). Presence of crowding agent affected beta-Gal structural content and increased its thermal resistance. Steady state fluorescence and Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopic observations are compatible with crowding-induced disordering and restricted internal dynamics as a result of excluded volume and solvent structuring effects. This leads to a non-optimal substrate-binding site and a less conformationally strained protein. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

From nanotechnology to industrial processing, these complexes are used for many purposes: to build multilayer particles for biosensors; to entrap and deliver proteins for pharmaceutical applications; to isolate and immobilize proteins. The enteric copolymer poly(methacrylic acid-co-methyl methacrylate) 1:2 (MMA) has been designed for drug delivery although its chemical properties allow to use it for other applications. Understanding the interaction between trypsin and this polymer is very important in order to optimize the mechanism of formation of this complex for different biotechnological applications. he formation of the trypsin-MMA complex was studied by spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry. Structural analysis of trypsin was carried out by catalytic activity assays, circular dichroism and differential scanning calorimetry. Isothermal titration calorimetry experiments showed that the insoluble complex contains 12 trypsin molecules per MMA molecule at pH 5 and they interact with high affinity to form insoluble complexes. Both electrostatic and hydrophobic forces are involved in the formation of the complex. The structure of trypsin is not affected by the presence of MMA, although it interacts with some domains of trypsin affecting its thermal denaturation as seen in the differential scanning calorimetry experiments. Its catalytic activity is not altered. Dynamic light scattering demonstrated the presence of a soluble trypsin-copolymer complex at pH 5 and 8. Turbidimetric assays show that the insoluble complex can be dissolved by low ionic strength and/or pH in order to obtain free native trypsin. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Material and methods: Fifty-two patients with DTC, 45 females (86.5%) and 7 males (13.5%) with a mean age of 44.21 +/- 13.3 years (r = 17-74) who received ablation therapy with 1311 after total thyroidectomy. Patients with diseases and/or medication causing xerostomia were excluded. Patients underwent salivary gland scintigraphy with 99Tc (10mCi). Results: Eighteen patients (34.62%) had SD and received antibiotics, antispasmodics, and oral steroids for 15 days. They were divided into two groups: responders to medical therapy (n = 12, age 44.3 +/- 14.4 years, 2 men [17%], 10 women [83%], cumulative dose 225 +/- 167.1 mCi) and non-responders to medical treatment, who underwent steroid instillation into the Stensen's duct (n = 6 [33%], 2 men [33%], 4 women [67%], age 50 +/- 13.8 years, cumulative dose 138.3 +/- 61.7 mCi). Scintigraphy showed damage to the parotid and submaxillary glands. Conclusion: Incidence of 131I-induced sialadenitis was similar to that reported by other authors. Age, mean cumulative dose of 1311, and involvement of parotid and submaxillary glands did not condition response to CMT; however, male sex was a conditioning factor. Symptom persistence for more than 15 days makes instillation into the Stensen's duct advisable. This is an effective and safe method to avoid surgical excision of salivary glands. (C) 2015 SEEN.

Furthermore, it has been shown that females of some species e.g., Anastrepha ludens (Loew) (Diptera: Tephritidae) - preferentially copulate with 'old', sexually experienced males, rather than younger and inexperienced males. Long-lived sterile males may therefore have greater opportunity to find and mate with wild females than short-lived males, and be more effective in inducing sterility into wild populations. We explored the feasibility of increasing sterile male lifespan through selection of long-lived strains and provision of pre-release diets with added protein, and inoculated with bacterial symbionts recovered from cultures of the gut of wild Anastrepha obliqua (Macquart). Artificial selection for long-lived A. ludens resulted in a sharp drop of fecundity levels for F1 females. Nevertheless, the cross of long-lived males with laboratory females produced a female F1 progeny with fecundity levels comparable to those of females in the established colony. However, the male progeny of long-lived males*laboratory females did not survive in higher proportions than laboratorymales. Provision of sugar to A. obliqua adults resulted in increased survival in comparison to adults provided only with water, whereas the addition of protein to sugar-only diets had no additional effect on longevity. Non-irradiated males lived longer than irradiated males, and supplying a generic probiotic diet produced no noticeable effect in restoring irradiated male longevity of A. obliqua. We discuss the need to evaluate the time to reach sexual maturity and survival under stress for long-lived strains, and the inclusion of low amounts of protein and specific beneficial bacteria in prerelease diets to increase sterilemale performance and longevity in the field.

We investigated whether habitats (ecotopes) and host-feeding sources influenced wing FA of the hematophagous bug Triatoma infestans. Because bug populations occupying distinct habitats differed substantially and consistently in various aspects such as feeding rates, engorgement status and the proportion of gravid females, we predicted that bugs from more open peridomestic habitats (i.e., goat corrals) were more likely to exhibit higher FA than bugs from domiciles. We examined patterns of asymmetry and the amount of wing size and shape FA in 196 adult T. infestans collected across a gradient of habitat suitability and stability that decreased from domiciles, storerooms, kitchens, chicken coops, pig corrals, to goat corrals in a well-defined area of Figueroa, northwestern Argentina. The bugs had unmixed blood meals on human, chicken, pig and goat depending on the bug collection ecotope. We documented the occurrence of FA in wing shape for bugs fed on all host-feeding sources and in all ecotopes except for females from domiciles or fed on humans. FA indices for wing shape differed significantly among host-feeding sources, ecotopes and sexes. The patterns of wing asymmetry in females from domiciles and from goat corrals were significantly different; differences in male FA were congruent with evidence showing that they had higher mobility than females across habitats. The host-feeding sources and habitats of T. infestans affected wing developmental stability depending on sex. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Methods: Data on BB ingestion/inhalation have been obtained from the ButtonBattexyDB. The ButtonBatteryDB is a database collecting information on BB injuries in children (0-18 years of age). Data on 348 BB injures have been derived from the Registry of Foreign Body Injuries "Susy Safe" (269 cases) and from published scientific literature reporting case reports of FB injuries (79 cases). Results: Most of injured children were male and BBs were found more often in the mouth/esophagus/ stomach (ICD935) and in the nose (ICD932). Analyzing symptoms related to BB located in the esophagus/ mouth/stomach, we found that children had higher probability of experiencing dysphagia (30.19%, 95% C.I. 17.83-42.55), fever and cough (26.42%, 95% C.I. 14.55-38.28), compared to the other symptoms. Referring to the probability that symptoms occurred simultaneously, fever and cough are more likely (3.72%, 95% C.I. 1.0-6-43) to jointly showing up in children with BB in mouth/esophagus/stomach (ICD935), followed by fever and dysphagia (2.66%, 95% C.I. 0.36-4.96) and by fever and irritability/crying, fever and drooling, dysphagia and irritability/crying (2.13% C.I. 0.00-4.19, 95% C.I.) Conclusions: These findings provide new insight in clinical presentation of BB injuries: the identification of unique patterns of symptoms related to BB injuries is useful to perform an early diagnosis (and to guarantee a prompt medical reaction), also when the injury is un-witnessed.

Adults of this species were identified recently in northern Argentina by dissection of male genitalia. In this work, a rapid and simple molecular tool was designed to distinguish H. armigera from the morphologically similar indigenous bollworms Helicoverpa zea (Boddie) and Helicoverpa gelotopoeon (Dyar), regardless of the life stage. Amplification of partial COI gene with a new primer pair, and subsequent digestion with endonuclease HinfI, yielded different RFLP profiles for the three main Helicoverpa pests currently present in South America. The method was validated in Helicoverpa specimens collected across Argentina, whose identity was further corroborated by COI sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. The data reported here constitute the first molecular confirmation of this pest in the country. The survey revealed the occurrence of H. armigera in northern and central Argentina, including the main soybean- and maize-producing area.

Aldosterone stimulates the cardiac sodium/bicarbonate cotransporter via activation of the g protein-coupled receptor gpr30	JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR CARDIOLOGY			English	Article						Aldosterone; GPR30; Sodium/bicarbonate cotransporter; Cardiomyocytes	GROWTH-FACTOR RECEPTOR; ESTROGEN-RECEPTOR; VENTRICULAR MYOCYTES; INTRACELLULAR PH; ANGIOTENSIN-II; NA+/HCO3-COTRANSPORT; REPERFUSION INJURY; SIGNALING PATHWAY; ENHANCED ACTIVITY; RENAL TUBULE	Some cardiac non-genomic effects of aldosterone (Aid) are reported to be mediated through activation of the classic mineralocorticoid receptor (MR). However, in the last years, it was proposed that activation of the novel G protein-coupled receptor GPR30 mediates certain non-genomic effects of Aid. The aim of this study was to elucidate if the sodium/bicarbonate cotransporter (NBC) is stimulated by Ald and if the activation of GPR30 mediates this effect. NBC activity was evaluated in rat cardiomyocytes perfused with HCO3-/CO2 solution in the continuous presence of HOE642 (sodium/hydrogen exchanger blocker) during recovery from acidosis using intracellular fluorescence measurements. Aid enhanced NBC activity (% of Delta J(HCO3-); control: 100 +/- 5.82%, n = 7 vs Ald: 151.88 +/- 11.02%, n = 5; P <0.05), which was prevented by G15 (GPR30 blocker, 90.53 +/- 7.81%, n = 7). Further evidence for the involvement of GPR30 was provided by G1 (GPR30 agonist), which stimulated NBC (185.13 +/- 1828%, n = 6; P< 0.05) and this effect was abrogated by G15 (124.19 +/- 10.96%, n = 5). Ald- and G1-induced NBC stimulation was abolished by the reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger MPG and by the NADPH oxidase inhibitor apocynin. In addition, G15 prevented Ald- and G1-induced ROS production. Pre-incubation of myocytes with wortmannin (PI3K-AKT pathway blocker) prevented Ald- or G1-induced NBC stimulation. In summary, Ald stimulates NBC by GPR30 activation, ROS production and ART stimulation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We studied post-copulatory guarding behavior and the factors affecting it, such as the presence of burrows, female receptivity duration, operational sex ratio (OSR) and male size, in two different populations of Neohelice granulata: Mar Chiquita coastal lagoon (MCL) and San Antonio Oeste (SAO). Laboratory experiments showed that post-copulatory guarding duration varied between the study areas. In MCL, it depended upon the presence of burrows and female receptivity duration, whereas it was independent of the OSR and male size. In SAO, it was dependent upon the OSR and female receptivity duration, whereas it was independent of the presence of burrows and male size. Thus, N. granulata males display different reproductive strategies related to their post-copulatory guarding behavior pattern in different habitats. These strategies are related to the fact that this species constructs and defends a burrow that provides shelter and a place to mate, something that other varunids do not have.

Subscapular and triceps skinfolds reference values of Hispanic American children and adolescents and their comparison with the reference of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)	NUTRICION HOSPITALARIA			English	Article						Adiposity; Anthropometry; Spain; Latin-america; Childhood; Adolescence	SCHOOL-AGED CHILDREN; BODY-MASS INDEX; GROWTH REFERENCE; CENTILE CURVES; ETHNIC-GROUPS; LMS METHOD; FAT; OBESITY; OVERWEIGHT; FATNESS	Introduction: the assessment of the skinfold thickness is an objective measure of adiposity. Therefore, it is a useful tool for nutritional diagnosis and prevention of metabolic risk associated with excess fat in chilhood and adolescence. Objective: to provide percentiles of subscapular and triceps skinfolds for Hispanic American schoolchildren and compare them with those published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) from United States, that it have been commonly used as a reference in most of these countries. Methods: subscapular and triceps skinfolds were measured in 9.973 schoolchildren 4-19 aged from Spain, Argentina, Cuba, Venezuela and Mexico with Holtain caliper with 0.2 mm accuracy. Percentiles were obtained with the LMS statistical method and were presented in tables divided in stages of 6 months and in curves graphics. The difference between Hispanic American and CDC mean values were provided for P3, P50 and P97 in mm and also were graphically represented. Results: sldnfolds measurements obviously increased with age in both sexes but, in boys, this increase is much more marked in highest percentiles between 8 and 13 years; this maximum is reached earlier than what occurs in CDC reference. In both sexes, all percentiles analized in Hispanic American schoolchildren were higher than the CDC reference except P97 up to 10 or 13 years that was notably smaller. Conclusions: the skinfolds percentiles of Hispanic American children and adolescents differ from CDC that are usually used as reference. The values of subscapular and triceps skinfolds provided in this study, could be applied to populations of a similar ethnic background, especially in comparative studies of body composition.

The sequence of the sodium-hydrogen antiporter 3 regulator 1 (SLC9A3R1) gene that codes for the PDZ2 motif of the Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor 1 (NHERF1) protein was analyzed. Changes in migration and cell transformation, and alterations of growth factor signaling pathways have been described in cells lacking endogenous NHERF1 or expressing an isoform lacking the function of the PDZ2 domain. Exons 2 and 3, together with flanking intronic sequences of the SLC9A3R1 gene, were amplified and bi-directionally sequenced in 31 primary tumor samples from epithelial ovarian cancer patients. In total, 3 different previously undescribed mutations were detected in 8 out of 31 serous adenocarcinoma tumor samples (25.8%). Bioinformatics analysis predicted a significant effect in the splicing process as a result of the mutations that could disrupt the NHERF1 PDZ2 domain. Point mutations in consensus splicing recognition are a major cause of the splicing defects that are found in several diseases, including cancer. It has previously been shown that a lack of exon 2 and disruption of the PDZ2 domain contribute to cell transformation and leads to modifications in the physiological regulation of the conformational state of NHERF1. Further studies in bigger groups of ovarian cancer patients will determine the importance of this mutation in disease progression and patient survival.

Alpha particles diffusion due to charge changes	PHYSICS OF PLASMAS			English	Article							ITER	Alpha particles diffusion due to charge changes in a magnetized plasma is studied. Analytical calculations and numerical simulations are employed to show that this process can be very important in the pedestal-edge-SOL regions. This is the first study that presents clear evidence of the importance of atomic processes on the diffusion of alpha particles. A simple 1D model that includes inelastic collisions with plasma species, "cold" neutrals, and partially ionized species was employed. The code, which follows the exact particle orbits and includes the effect of inelastic collisions via a Monte Carlo type random process, runs on a graphic processor unit (GPU). The analytical and numerical results show excellent agreement when a uniform background (plasma and cold species) is assumed. The simulations also show that the gradients in the density of the plasma and cold species, which are large and opposite in the edge region, produce an inward flux of alpha particles. Calculations of the alpha particles flux reaching the walls or divertor plates should include these processes. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.	[Clauser, C.

First, the semen and sperm variables were recorded and validated through their own repeatability. Semen collection intervals tested were: 1X/week for three weeks and 3X/week for another three weeks, the second collection period occurring after two weeks of sexual rest. The collection frequency of 3X/week significantly reduced (P<0.05) the sperm viability, motility, concentration, Total Sperm/Ejaculate, Total Motile Sperm/Ejaculate and Total Live Sperm/Ejaculate, but improved Total Sperm/Week and Total Live Sperm/Week. All recorded variables were significantly higher during the summer in comparison to the spring with the exception of morphology abnormalities, volume, and viability. Also, the 1X/week versus the 3X/week semen collection frequencies did not produce a significant difference in the percent of total motile sperm/week. Based on semen and sperm characteristics evaluated herein, Llama semen collected in the summer was better (P<0.05), with regard to the majority of the variables analyzed, than semen collected in the spring.

Variances in the Use of Everolimus in Kidney Transplantation: A 2-Year Registry of Everyday Practice	TRANSPLANTATION PROCEEDINGS			English	Article							CALCINEURIN-INHIBITOR; HLA ANTIBODIES; CYCLOSPORINE; RECIPIENTS; CONVERSION; EFFICACY; SAFETY; MYCOPHENOLATE; EXPERIENCE; EXPOSURE	Background. Everolimus (EVL)-based immunosuppressive strategies may permit the reduction of calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) and their side effects, while offering a safe and efficient treatment. Our aim was to describe our experience with EVL in everyday practice and provide information for its optimal utilization. Methods. Prospective, multicenter study of 181 kidney transplant recipients treated with EVL as part of their immunosuppressive regimen, with a follow-up of 24 months. We studied demographic data, transplant characteristics, clinical information, drugs used, serum creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGER), rejection episodes, and adverse events. Results. In total, 181 renal transplant recipients were included. Of these, 30 (16.6%) received EVL de novo and 151 (83.4%) were converted; median time from transplantation to conversion was 10 (range, 1-312) months. Main reasons for conversion were prevention of interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (23.9%), intolerance to immunosuppressants (11.1%), neoplasia (13.9%), nephrotoxicity (8.9%), and cytomegalovirus infections (8.3%). The eGFR values at baseline, months 12, and 24 were 46.4 +/- 27.4 mL/min, 54.8 +/- 22.9 mL/min, and 55.9 +/- 26.5 ml/min, respectively. Two of 181 (1.1%) patients died, 5 of 181 (2.8%) lost their grafts, 12 of 181 (6.6%) had an episode of acute rejection, 13 of 181 (7.2%) had >= 1 serious event and infection, and 85 of 181 (49.9%) had >= 1 nonserious adverse event or infection. Multivariate analysis showed that increased eGER at month 24 was associated with lower donor age, shorter time from transplant to EVL introduction, and a baseline eGFR >= 40 mL/min. Conclusion. Through different strategies among centers, the inclusion of EVL improved renal function during the first 12 months.

Photodynamic therapy (PDT), a minimally invasive therapeutic modality, is a promising approach to treating melanoma. It combines a non-toxic photoactivatable drug called photosensitizer with harmless visible light to generate reactive oxygen species which mediate the antitumor effects. The aim of this review was to compile the available data about PDT on melanoma. Our comparative analysis revealed a disconnection between several hypotheses generated by in vitro therapeutic studies and in vivo and clinical assays. This fact led us to highlight new preclinical experimental platforms that mimic the complexity of tumor biology. The tumor and its stromal microenvironment have a dynamic and reciprocal interaction that plays a critical role in tumor resistance, and these interactions can be exploited for novel therapeutic targets. In this sense, we review two strategies used by photodynamic researchers: (a) developing 3D culture systems which mimic tumor architecture and (b) heterotypic cultures that resemble tumor microenvironment to favor therapeutic regimen design. After this comprehensive review of the literature, we suggest that new complementary preclinical models are required to better optimize the clinical outcome of PDT on skin melanoma.

To achieve this, it is used a non-systematic reconstruction of the initial approaches to this subject, taking as unit of analysis the historizations performed by the first field researchers. This reconstruction is focused on the north American context, since these publications were the first to give an account for a new area of research and intervention, nearly twenty years earlier than the publications in Latin America. a systematic reading of these sources is performed, in order to identify the theoretical-conceptual frameworks and central categories used in the inaugural moment. in the line of work proposed there is an investigation on the conditions for theming violence in the family, and the present perspectives in the first approaches, as well as some of the conceptual tensions in the definitions proposed by relevant authors, which will have a central place in contemporary theorizing.

Diagnoses of women present in the protocols made by 1900-1930 at the above mentioned hospital will be addressed. There will be a relevant comparison between the Hospicio de las Mercedes (male patients only) and the mentioned hospital during the same period. Considering the methodology related to the file work the analysis of the material will be made taking also into consideration the discourse analysis. When comparing the diagnoses of women and men in the Hospital Nacional de Alienadas and the Hospicio de las Mercedes respectively, we found striking differences. Firstly, there are unique diagnoses for women (related to genitourinary functions), in addition, men's diagnostic criteria at the time was implemented more rapidly in men's medical records, leaving women's diagnoses outdated. The most outstanding diagnoses at the Hospital Nacional de Alienadas were: early dementia, insane dementia, moral insanity, puerperal insanity, hysteria, ovarian failure (Menopause), menstrual madness. The prevalent diagnoses in the Hospicio de las Mercedes were: degeneration, dementia praecox, general progressive paralysis and alcoholism.

Korn. information was also obtained on the conception of psychic suffering and the possible modifications in attention since the enactment of law 26657. For this exploratory study it was used a qualitative methodology (semi-structured interviews with professionals from different disciplines). The analysis of their answers led to two paradoxical logics of operation: an inclusive one and a segregative one. The professionals pointed out the difficulty to modify the latter, since even in the case of devices that work inclusively the inertia of the segregative logic may appear. in the discussion, it is highlighted the role of education and continuous professional training as a key to encouraged an inclusive and versatile logic devices in mental Health care.

PM10 emissions from aggregate fractions of an Entic Haplustoll under two contrasting tillage systems	AEOLIAN RESEARCH			English	Article						PM10 emission; Tillage systems; Dry aggregate distribution; Organic matter	SOIL ORGANIC-MATTER; WIND EROSION; DUST; TEXTURE; MANAGEMENT	Tillage systems affect physical and chemical properties of soils modifying its aggregation. How changes of the aggregate size distribution affect the capacity of the soil to emit fine particulate matter (PM10) to the atmosphere during wind erosion processes, is a less investigated issue. In order to answer this question, PM10 emissions from an Entic Haplustoll submitted to 25 years of continuous conventional tillage (LC) and no-till (NT) were analyzed. Soil samples were sieved with a rotary sieve in order to determine the aggregate size distribution (fractions : <0.42 mm, 0.42-0.84 mm, 0.84-2 mm, 2-6.4 mm, 6.4-19.2 mm, and >19.2 mm), the dry aggregate stability (DAS) and the erodible fraction (EF). The organic matter contents (OM), the particle size composition and the PM10 emission of each aggregate fraction were also measured. Results showed that NT promoted OM accumulations in all aggregate fractions which favored DAS and soil aggregation. The <0.42 mm sized aggregates (27%) predominated in CT and the >19.2 mm (41.7%) in NT, while the proportion of the other aggregate fractions was similar in both tillage systems. As a consequence of the smaller proportion of the <0.42 mm aggregates, the erodible fraction was lower in NT (EF: 17.3%) than in CT (30.8%). PM10 emissions of each aggregate fraction (AE) decreased exponentially with increasing size of the fractions in both tillage systems, mainly as a consequence of the smaller size and higher specific surface. AE was higher in CT than in NT for all aggregate fractions, but the higher differences were found in the <0.42 mm aggregates (18 mu g g(-1) in CT vs 8 mu g g(-1) in NT). The PM10 emission of the whole soil was three times higher in CT than in NT, while the emission of the erodible fraction (EFE) was in CT four times higher than in NT. PM10 emissions of the <0.42 mm aggregates represented over 50% of SE and 90% of EFE. We concluded that NT reduced the capacity of soils of the semiarid Pampas to emit PM10 because it produced a better aggregation that reduced the proportion and emission of the <0.42 mm aggregates. These aggregates had, by far, the highest emission potential. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Neutron flux assessment of a neutron irradiation facility based on inertial electrostatic confinement fusion	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	16th International Congress on Neutron Capture Therapy (ICNCT)	JUN 14-19, 2014	Helsinki, FINLAND			Explanted organ BNCT; Neutron irradiation; Inertial electrostatic confinement fusion	LIVER	Neutron generators based on inertial electrostatic confinement fusion were considered for the design of a neutron irradiation facility for explanted organ Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) that could be installed in a health care center as well as in research areas. The chosen facility configuration is "irradiation chamber", a similar to 20 x 20 x 40 cm(3) cavity near or in the center of the facility geometry where samples to be irradiated can be placed. Neutron flux calculations were performed to study different manners for improving scattering processes and, consequently, optimize neutron flux in the irradiation position. Flux distributions were assessed through numerical simulations of several models implemented in MCNP5 particle transport code. Simulation results provided a wide spectrum of combinations of net fluxes and energy spectrum distributions. Among them one can find a group that can provide thermal neutron fluxes per unit of production rate in a range from 4.1. 10(-4) cm(-2) to 1.6. 10(-3) cm(-2) with epithermal-to-thermal ratios between 0.3% and 13% and fast-to-thermal ratios between 0.01% to 8%. Neutron generators could be built to provide more than 10(19) n s(-1) and, consequently, with an arrangement of several generators appropriate enough neutron fluxes could be obtained that would be useful for several BNCT-related irradiations and, eventually, for clinical practice.

Reprint of Bioneutronics: Thermal scattering in organics tissues and its impact on BNCT dosimetry (Reprinted)	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Reprint						Thermal scattering; BNCT; Dosimetry	NEUTRON-CAPTURE THERAPY; MODELS; WATER	Neutron transport calculation is a key factor in BNCT numerical dosimetry assessments where thermal neutron flux is intimately related to the neutron dose, specially, the therapeutic boron dose. In this work, numerical calculations in phantoms were performed to determine the importance of utilizing the appropriate thermal scattering treatment for different organic tissues. Two thermal treatments for the neutron scattering were included in the simulations: hydrogen bounded in bulk water and hydrogen bounded in a lipid like carbon chain (polyethylene). The results showed difference between both thermal treatments that can reach several percent points depending on the type of source and irradiated geometry. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Based on former studies, the strategy considers the use of immunoliposomes as boron carriers nanovehicles to target HER2 overexpressing cells. The essential concerns of the current stage of this proposal are the development of carriers that can improve the efficiency of delivery of boron compounds and the dosimetric assessment of treatment feasibility. For this purpose, an specific pool of clinical cases that can benefit from this application was determined. In this work, we present the proposal and the advances related to the different stages of current research. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.	[Gadan, M. A.; Gonzalez, S.

METHODS: Between October 2007 and January 2011 we conducted a retrospective review of a series of 65 patients from 2 different centers. We analyzed demographic data, surgical outcomes and complications. RESULTS: Patient mean age was 50.09 years (range: 25 to 75), mean stricture length was 3.95 cm (range: 3 to 7 cm) and mean follow-up 33.13 months (range: 12.7 to 52.77). Eighty percent of patients had prior treatments, mainly direct visual internal urethrotomy (DVIU) and urethral dilatation. Most frequent etiologies were iatrogenic in 46.15% of patients and idiopathic in 35.38% of patients. Success rate was achieved in 96.92% of patients; only 2 patients presented recurrence and were treated successfully with one DVIU. Clavien Dindo complications were found in 59% of patients. No patient had chronic sequels. CONCLUSION: Augmented anastomotic urethroplasty using dorsal onlay buccal mucosa graft enables correction, in one time, of long segment urethral strictures with severe spongiofibrosis and/or obliterated lumen. Our outcomes are comparable with those of previously reported in international series.

The present literature does not give a satisfactory answer to the question about the nature of the "Antlia galaxy cluster". Aims. The radial velocities of galaxies found in the region around the giant ellipticals NGC 3258/3268 range from about 1000 km s(-1) to 4000 km s(-1). We characterise this region and its possible kinematical and population substructure. Methods. We have obtained VLT-VIMOS multi-object spectra of the galaxy population in the inner part of the Antlia cluster and measure radial velocities for 45 potential members. We supplement our galaxy sample with literature data, ending up with 105 galaxy velocities. Results. We find a large radial velocity dispersion for the entire sample as reported in previous papers. However, we find three groups at about 1900 km s(-1), 2800 km s(-1), and 3700 km s(-1), which we interpret as differences in the recession velocities rather than peculiar velocities. Conclusions. The high radial velocity dispersion of galaxies in the Antlia region reflects a considerable extension along the line of sight.	[Caso, J.

We study the O-type star HD 161853, which has been noted as a probable double-lined spectroscopic binary system. Methods. We secured high-resolution spectra of HD 161853 during the past nine years. We separated the two components in the system and measured their respective radial velocities for the first time. Results. We confirm that HD 161853 is an similar to 1 Ma old binary system consisting of an O8 V star (M-A,M-RV >= 22 M-circle dot) and a B1-3 V star (M-B,M-RV >= 7.2 M-circle dot) at about 1.3 kpc. From the radial velocity curve, we measure an orbital period P = 2.66765 +/- 0.00001 d and an eccentricity e = 0.121 +/- 0.007. Its V-band light curve is constant within 0.014 mag and does not display eclipses, from which we impose a maximum orbital inclination i = 54 deg. HD 161853 is probably associated with an H ii region and a poorly investigated very young open cluster. In addition, we detect a compact emission region at 50 arcsec to HD 161853 in 22 mu m-WISE and 24 mu m-Spitzer images, which may be identified as a dust wave piled up by the radiation pressure of the massive binary system.

On the origin of two unidentified radio/X-ray sources discovered with XMM-Newton	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						X-rays: ISM; radiation mechanisms: non-thermal; stars: neutron; radio continuum: general	PHOTON IMAGING CAMERA; PULSAR WIND NEBULAE; SOURCE CATALOG; DATA RELEASE; JET; EMISSION; CHANDRA; CURVE; GASS	Aims. We aim at clarifying the nature of the emission of two spatially related unidentified X-ray sources detected with XMM-Newton telescope at intermediate-low Galactic latitude Methods. We use the imaging and spectral capabilities of XMM-Newton to study the X-ray properties of these two sources. In addition, we complement our study with radio data obtained at different frequencies to analyze a possible physical association between the sources. Results. Observations reveal a point-like source aligned with elongated diffuse emission. The X-ray spectra of these sources is best-fitted by an absorbed power law with photon index Gamma similar to 1.7 for the point-like source and similar to 2.0 for the extended source. Both sources show nonthermal radio-continuum counterparts that might indicate a physical association. In addition, from the available data, we did not detect variability on the point-like source in several timescales. Two possible scenarios are analyzed: one Galactic and one extra-Galactic. First, based on HI line absorption, assuming a Galactic origin, we infer a distance upper bound of less than or similar to 2 kpc, which poses a constraint on the height over the Galactic plane of less than or similar to 200 pc and on the linear size of the system of less than or similar to 2.3 pc. In this case, the X-ray luminosities are greater than or similar to 10(32) erg s(-1) and greater than or similar to 7.5 x 10(32) erg s(-1), for the point-like and extended sources, respectively. Second, an extra-Galactic nature is discussed, where the point-like source might be the core of a radio galaxy and the extended source its lobe. In this case, we compare derived fluxes, spectral indices, and spatial correlation with those typical from the radio galaxy population, showing the feasibility of this alternative astrophysical scenario. Conclusions. From the available observational evidence, we suggest that the most promising scenario to explain the nature of these sources is a system consisting of a one-sided radio galaxy, where the point-like source is an active galactic nucleus and the extended source corresponds to the emission from its lobe. Other possibilities include a pulsar and its associated pulsar wind nebula, where the radio/X-ray emission originates from the synchrotron cooling of relativistic particles in the pulsar's magnetic field or a casual alignment between two unrelated sources, such as an active galactic nucleus and a Galactic X-ray blob. Deeper dedicated observations in both radio and X-ray bands are needed to fully understand the nature of these sources.

KIC 9821622: An interesting lithium-rich giant in the Kepler field	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						stars: fundamental parameters; stars: abundances; stars: individual: KIC 9821622; stars: chemically peculiar; stars: late-type; techniques: spectroscopic	MASS RED GIANTS; EVOLVED STARS; STELLAR PARAMETERS; K-GIANTS; CHEMICAL ABUNDANCES; LARGE-SAMPLE; BRANCH; ENRICHMENT; EVOLUTION; PLANET	We report the discovery of a new exceptional young lithium-rich giant, KIC 9821622, in the Kepler field that exhibits an unusually large enhancement of alpha, Fe-peak, and r-process elements. From high-resolution spectra obtained with GRACES at Gemini North, we derived fundamental parameters and detailed chemical abundances of 23 elements from equivalent widths and synthesis analysis. By combining atmospheric stellar parameters with available asteroseismic data, we obtained the stellar mass, radius, and age. The data analysis reveals that KIC 9821622 is a Li-rich (A(Li)(NLTE) = 1.80 +/- 0.2) intermediate-mass giant star (M = 1.64 M-circle dot) located at the red giant branch near the luminosity bump. We find unexpectedly elevated abundances of Fe-peak and r-process elements. In addition, as previously reported, we find that this is a young star (2.37 Gyr) with unusually high abundances of alpha-elements ([alpha/Fe] = 0.31). The evolutionary status of KIC 9821622 suggests that its Li-rich nature is the result of internal fresh Li that is synthesized through the Cameron-Fowler mechanism near the luminosity bump. However, its peculiar enhancement of alpha, Fe-peak, and r-process elements opens the possibility of external contamination by material enriched by a supernova explosion. Although it is less likely, planet accretion cannot be ruled out.

Angular momentum evolution for galaxies in a Lambda-CDM scenario	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						Galaxy: abundances; Galaxy: evolution; dark matter	PARTICLE HYDRODYNAMICS SIMULATIONS; DARK-MATTER HALOES; COSMOLOGICAL SIMULATIONS; COMPACT SPHEROIDS; MULTIPHASE MODEL; METAL ENRICHMENT; GAS ACCRETION; DISK GALAXIES; MASS; FEEDBACK	Context. Galaxy formation in the current cosmological paradigm is a very complex process in which inflows, outflows, interactions, and mergers are common events. These processes can redistribute the angular momentum content of baryons. Recent observational results suggest that disc formed conserving angular momentum while elliptical galaxies, although they lose angular momentum, determine a correlation between the specific angular momentum of the galaxy and the stellar mass. These observations provide stringent constraints for galaxy formation models in a hierarchical clustering scenario. Aims. We aim to analyse the specific angular momentum content of the disc and bulge components as a function of virial mass, stellar mass, and redshift. We also estimate the size of the simulated galaxies and compare them with observations. Methods. We use cosmological hydrodynamical simulations that include an effective, physically motivated supernova feedback which is able to regulate the star formation in haloes of different masses. We analyse the morphology and formation history of a sample of galaxies in a cosmological simulation by performing a bulge-disc decomposition of the analysed systems and their progenitors. We estimate the angular momentum content of the stellar and gaseous discs, stellar bulges, and total baryons. Results. In agreement with recent observational findings, our simulated galaxies have disc and spheroid components whose specific angular momentum content determine correlations with the stellar and dark matter masses with the same slope, although the spheroidal components are offset by a fixed fraction. The average angular momentum efficiency for the simulated discs is eta similar to 1, while for bulges it is eta similar to 0.10-0.20. For the simulated sample, the correlations found for the specific angular momentum content as a function of virial mass or stellar mass are found not to evolve significantly with redshift (up to z similar to 2). Both dynamical components seem to move along the correlations as they evolve. The total specific angular momentum of galaxies occupy different positions filling the gap between pure rotational-dominated and dispersion-dominated systems. The scaling relations derived from the simulated galaxies determine a similar relation with the virial radius, which is in agreement with recent observations.

Lepto-hadronic model for the broadband emission of Cygnus X-1	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						gamma rays: general; radiation mechanisms: non-thermal; X-rays: binaries; X-rays: individuals: Cygnus X-1	HIGH-ENERGY EMISSION; GAMMA-RAY EMISSION; ACCRETING BLACK-HOLES; X-RAY; ORBITAL MODULATION; MICROQUASAR JETS; MAGNETIC-FIELD; 3D SIMULATIONS; RADIO-EMISSION; GRS 1915+105	Context. Cygnus X-1 is a well-observed microquasar. Broadband observations at all wavelengths have been collected over the years. The origin of the MeV tail observed with COMPTEL and INTEGRAL is still under debate and it has mostly been attributed to the corona, although its high degree of polarization suggests that it is synchrotron radiation from a jet. The origin of the transient emission above similar to 100 GeV is also unclear. Aims. We aim to clarify the origin of the broadband spectral energy distribution (SED) of Cygnus X-1, focusing particularly on the gamma-ray emission, and to gain information on the physical conditions inside the jets. Methods. We developed a lepto-hadronic, inhomogeneous jet model and applied it to the non-thermal SED of Cygnus X-1. We calculated the contributions to the SED of both protons and electrons accelerated in an extended region of the jet. We also estimated the radiation of charged secondaries produced in hadronic interactions through several radiative processes. Absorption effects were considered. We produced synthetic maps of the jets at radio wavelengths. Results. We find two sets of model parameters that lead to good fits of the SED. One of the models fits all the observations, including the MeV tail. This model also predicts hadronic gamma-ray emission slightly below the current upper limits. The flux predicted at 8.4 GHz is in agreement with the observations available in the literature, although the synthetic source is more compact than the imaged radio jet. Conclusions. Our results show that the MeV emission in Cygnus X-1 may be jet synchrotron radiation. This depends mainly on the strength of the jet magnetic field and the location of the injection region of the relativistic particles. Our calculations show that there must be energetic electrons in the jets quite far from the black hole.

Terrestrial-type planet formation Comparing different types of initial conditions	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						planets and satellites: formation; planets and satellites: terrestrial planets; protoplanetary disks	MAIN-SEQUENCE STARS; WATER DELIVERY; HABITABLE PLANETS; TORQUE FORMULA; GIANT IMPACTS; RAPID GROWTH; MASS DISKS; MIGRATION; ACCRETION; EARTHS	Context. The initial distributions of planetary embryos and planetesimals used in N-body simulations play an important role for studies of the terrestrial-type planet formation during the post oligarchic growth. In general, most of these studies typically use ad hoc initial distributions based primarily on theoretical and numerical studies. Aims. We analyze the formation of planetary systems without gas giants around solar-type stars by focusing on the sensitivity of the results to the particular initial distributions used for planetesimals and planetary embryos at the end of the gas phase of the protoplanetary disk. The formation process of terrestrial planets in the habitable zone ( HZ) and their final water contents are also topics of special interest in this work. Methods. We developed two different sets of N-body simulations starting with the same protoplanetary disk. The first set assumes typical ad hoc initial distributions for embryos and planetesimals, and the second set obtains these initial distributions from the results of a semi-analytical model that simulates the evolution of the protoplanetary disk during the gaseous phase. Results. The two sets of simulations form planets within the HZ. Using ad hoc initial conditions, the masses of the planets that remain in the HZ range from 0.66 M-circle plus to 2.27 M-circle plus. Using more realistic initial conditions obtained from a semi-analytical model, we found that the masses of the planets range from 1.18 M-circle plus to 2.21 M-circle plus. Both sets of simulations form planets in the HZ with water contents ranging between 4.5% and 39.48% by mass. The planets that have the highest water contents with respect to those with the lowest water contents present differences regarding the sources of water supply. Conclusions. From comparing the two sets of simulations, we suggest that the number of planets that remain in the HZ is not sensitive to the particular initial distribution of embryos and planetesimals, and therefore the results are globally similar between them. However, the main differences observed between the two sets are associated with the accretion history of the planets in the HZ. These discrepancies have a direct impact on the accretion of water-rich material and the physical characteristics of the resulting planets.	[Ronco, M.

The potential energetic antagonism between reproduction and somatic growth was also evaluated. The number of eggs per spawn per female was highest in the first spawn, while the number of recently hatched juveniles per spawn per female declined in the sixth spawn. Lower lipid concentration and energy content were detected in eggs of the fourth and fifth spawns, which may indicate for the first time a decrease in maternal provisioning as a result of multiple spawning in a decapod with direct development. This result had no effect on the size of eggs or of recently hatched juveniles, nor on the growth performance of juveniles during a 30-day period following hatching. Lipids were the most abundant biochemical component of eggs, followed by proteins and glycogen; the relative proportion of each component was probably related to embryonic development type. Egg volume was unsuitable as an indicator of nutrient content, as no correlation was found between these variables. The physiological costs of reproduction were evident from the lower energy content of females that reproduced versus females that remained virgin. The lower body weight of the reproductive females at the end of the experiment showed that allocation of resources to reproduction occurred at the expense of somatic growth. To our knowledge, this is the first empirical demonstration of a decapod with direct development.

It is freely available as a web service, allowing a single access point to almost all state-of-the-art feature extraction methods used today in a variety of works from different authors. It has a very simple user interface, where the user only needs to load a file containing the input sequences and select the features to extract. As a result, the user obtains a text file with the features extracted, which can be used to analyze the sequences or as input to a miRNA prediction software. The tool can calculate up to 80 features where many of them are multidimensional arrays. In order to simplify the web interface, the features have been divided into six pre-defined groups, each one providing information about: primary sequence, secondary structure, thermodynamic stability, statistical stability, conservation between genomes of different species and substrings analysis of the sequences. Additionally, pre-trained classifiers are provided for prediction in different species. All algorithms to extract the features have been validated, comparing the results with the ones obtained from software of the original authors.

The aim of this work was to carry out a survey on the airborne fungal charge and other bioaerosols associated with a repository of mummified legacy from the Argentinian North West from the La Plata Museum. Two types of monitoring were performed: i) a viable and non viable aerobiological sampling in the exterior air of the repository, in the indoor air within the same and inside 3 cabinets containing human remains; and ii) a study and culture of the micobiota associated to the surface of materials with evident signs of biodeterioration. Based on the aerobiological sampling, the greatest diversity and spore concentration was registered in the outside environment, being Cladosporium cladosporioides, Altemaria sp. and Penicillium sp. the most representative taxa. Either inside the repository of the 3 cabinets, showed a particular fungal charge, the presence of Penicillium sp., Cladosporium sp. and Aspergillus sp. was characteristic. The analysis of contact samples makes evident the presence of Cladosporium herbarum, Penicillium frequentans and Talaromyces helicus. The knowledge of fungal microorganisms present in indoor environments is essential for heritage conservation and human health subjects.

III. Within the framework of the research on high mountain wetlands conducted since 1998, we have already studied 24 waterbodies in this province. In order to expand our knowledge on diatom flora in these high mountain environments, in this opportunity we analyze another 12 wetlands located between 25 degrees 34'05 ''-27 degrees 39'23 '' S, over 3000 m asl. Diatoms were found in all samples, except in Laguna Azul, with almost white water by the large amount of suspended solids. In relation to salinity, waters were from fresh to hypersaline, with a predominance of sodium and chloride ions. We identify, excluding Fragilariaceae, 42 genera with 123 infrageneric taxa, 29 of which are new records for the province of Catamarca and, 4 for Argentina and we propose a new species (Anomoeoneis punae sp nov.). The majority of the species belong to Navicula (17), Nitzschia (13), Ha/amphora (12), Surirella (8), and Anomoeoneis (7). There were not found species common to all samples and only six appeared in more than 50% of the waterbodies. A high percentage (54%) of rare species, found only in one or two of the samples, was obtained.

BOLETIN DE LA SOCIEDAD ARGENTINA DE BOTANICA			Spanish	Article						Epilithon; physicochemical variables; Calimayo Stream	PHYTOPLANKTON; RIVERS	Epilithic phycoflora and environmental variables of Calimayo Stream (Tucuman-Argentina). Tucuman is known for its richness in natural and water resources. Previous phycological studies focused mainly on the phytoplankton, but little was done in relation to the epilithic phycoflora. The aim of this research was to analyze the epilithic taxocenosis and physicochemical variables of Calimayo stream during an annual cycle, and to contribute to the taxonomic knowledge of the phycoflora in Northwestern Argentina. Physicochemical and biological samples collected in 2012-2013 were studied. The water was alkaline, bicarbonate-calcium, oligosaprobic in summer/13 and oligo-beta-mesosaprobic in the other seasons. Mineralization was average and the stream was well oxygenated. The Bacillariohyceae class presented 69 taxa followed by Divisions Cyanophyta (10), Chlorophyta (5) and Rhodophyta (1). The following species were always present: Amphipleura lindheimerii, Cocconeis placentula var. lineata, Cymbal la affinis, Gomphonema olivaceum, G. parvulum, Luticola mutica, Navicula tripunctata, Nitzschla palea, Orthoseira roeseana, Planothidium frequentissimum, P. lanceolatum, Reimeria uniseriata, Rhoicosphenia abbreviate, Ulnaria ulna, Oedogonium sp., Lyngbya sp. 1, Myxosarcina spectabilis, Oscillatoria sp. 1 y 2. Of a total of 85 taxa, 70 are cited for the first time for epilithon and Myxosarcina spectabilis is a new record for Tucuman. Phycoflora composition was influenced by temperature, depth, precipitation and pH.

This paper deals with the study of leaf domatia in Argentine Rubiaceae, which are common morphogenetic structures on the underside of the leaves of woody plants, which can establish mutual relations with mites or ants. Tufts of hair, pockets, cavities and crypts: many families are classified into types common relatively well preserved. Around 290 families of "dicots" have domatia, Rubiaceae being the best represented with all known and transitional types. Domestic classification by molecular data, Rubiaceae divided into three subfamilies: Rubioideae, Ixorideae and Cinchonoideae. In Argentina inhabit 41 genera and 132 species of Rubiaceae, of which 34 are woody (27%). As result, tree domatia types were found: tuft of hair, pockets and crypt, present in 14 species of Rubiaceace. It is mentioned for the first time a domatia in a vine species of Manettia. The results were compared with recent molecular studies; this confirmed the plesiomorphic condition thereof, since different types are common to the three subfamilies almost all the tribes of the family. Based on this sampling, the following tribes completely lack domatia: Anthospermeae, Rubieae, Paederieae and Pavetteae.

Botanical characterization of its honeys. With the purpose of knowing the trophic resources used by Plebeia intermedia, a stingless bee of frequent use in Barit0 locality (22 degrees 28' 54.1 '' S; 64 degrees 45' 39.4 '' W; at 1546 masl), ten honey samples were melissopalynologically analyzed, collected in September and October of 2011 and in January of 2012. The qualitative examinations showed a certain specialization of these bees for using native and arboreal plants, and with flowers clustered in dense inflorescences (mass flowering). The dominant pollen types that originated monofloral honeys were Allophylus edulis (Sapindaceae), Blepharocalyx salicifolius (Myrtaceae) and Myrcianthes pseudomato (Myrtaceae), followed by Handroanthus ochraceus (Bignoniaceae), Ilex argentina (Aquifoliaceae), Parapiptadenia excelsa (Leguminosae) and Sambucus peruviana (Adoxaceae). Other pollen types observed in the samples, with frequency classes important minor or secondary, were Eupatorium (Compositae), Senecio (Compositae), Paullinia (Sapindaceae) and pollens of the families Boraginaceae and Rhamnaceae. The realized examinations in the honeys of Plebeia intermedia and results obtained in this study, constitute the first data on the trophic resources used by this species of stingless bee in the period spring - summer.

BOLETIN DE LA SOCIEDAD ARGENTINA DE BOTANICA			Spanish	Article						Floristic analysis; vegetation units; Chaco Region; Villa Escolar		Contribution to the floristic knowledge of the Eastern Chaco, Formosa province, Argentina. The southeastern of Formosa province integrates part of the Oriental Chaco, characterized by a great environmental heterogeneity, where woody components and grassland are mixed. This complex characteristic is linked to the forms of the landscape, which it is the result of alluvial dynamics during the Pleistocene-Holocene and of the migration of fluvial belts of principal rivers. In this contribution, the floristic composition of different communities of Laishi (Formosa) is analyzed, in order to establish the composition and variability of its elements. For this, species collected near the town, herbarium and bibliography data showed the presence of 625 species, where Asteraceae, Poaceae and Fabaceae families were predominated. There are different vegetation units: forests, palms, shrubs, mesophyte and hydrophyte grasslands, and marshes, where forests and hydrophyte grasslands are dominated. Spatial distribution of the vegetation was analyzed according to the topographic height preference, especially the distribution of tree communities. This information was obtained from satellite images. In addition, Amazon forest components (Yungas and Paranaense) among Chaquenian species were found.

Herbivores, and large mammals in particular, are capable of modifying not only the architecture of the species they graze on, but also growth rate, productivity and the way the plant uses its resources. This study analyze how cattle influence changes in resource allocation (to aerial biomass or root and/or reproductive or vegetative biomass) in two dominant species with different palatability, in a post-fire Nothofagus pumilio forest. The relationship between possible changes in resource allocation and the variables which indicate successful reproduction in these species (e.g., number of flowers and fruits) was also determined. The presence of cattle negatively affected the total biomass of the palatable species (R. magellanicum) and modified the proportions assigned to its shoot/root and vegetative/productive biomass. In contrast, the allocation of B. microphylla resources was unaffected by the cattle presence, but its highest reproductive success was associated with plants of larger size that occur in cattle plots. These results show that the cattle have different effects on the species: directly, through removal of biomass (on palatable species), and it's possible also indirectly, through changes in the availability of light (on non palatable species).

During the pre-dispersal stage, the seeds are predated by Anypsipyla univitella. The objectives of this study were to describe some reproductive parameters (size and number of fruits and seeds) of R. girolae, to quantify pre-dispersal seed loss by abortion and predation, and to test the effect on pre-dispersal seed predation of fruit production (per tree, of co-specific neighbors, and the sum of both), size of fruits, number of seeds per fruit, and number of predators per fruit. As seeds can be partially consumed by the predator, the viability of partially damaged seeds was assessed as well. At lschigualasto Park, we sampled 17 adult trees from 3 stands spaced 4 km apart. For each focal tree, we quantified the number of co-specific neighbors and their fruits. We collected ten fruits from canopies and recorded their length and the number and states of seeds (intact, predated, and aborted). Generalized Linear Mixed Models were fitted to evaluate explanatory variables affecting the proportion of pre-dispersal predated seeds. R. girolae suffers great loss of seeds during the pre-dispersal stage, mainly by seed predation (58% of seeds). The proportion of predated seeds was most important relative to the number of predators, the number of seeds per fruit, and the size of fruits. Fruits containing more predators, more seeds, and smaller fruits had higher proportions of predated seeds. Seed abortion would not represent an important factor of seed loss (6% of seeds).

Although the yeast lifestyle has evolved multiple times, most known species belong to the subphylum Saccharomycotina (syn. Hemiascomycota, hereafter yeasts). This diverse group includes the premier eukaryotic model system, Saccharomyces cerevisiae; the common human commensal and opportunistic pathogen, Candida albicans; and over 1000 other known species (with more continuing to be discovered). Yeasts are found in every biome and continent and are more genetically diverse than angiosperms or chordates. Ease of culture, simple life cycles, and small genomes (similar to 10-20 Mbp) have made yeasts exceptional models for molecular genetics, biotechnology, and evolutionary genomics. Here we discuss recent developments in understanding the genomic underpinnings of the making of yeast biodiversity, comparing and contrasting natural and human-associated evolutionary processes. Only a tiny fraction of yeast biodiversity and metabolic capabilities has been tapped by industry and science. Expanding the taxonomic breadth of deep genomic investigations will further illuminate how genome function evolves to encode their diverse metabolisms and ecologies.

Rainfall intensity switches ecohydrological runoff/runon redistribution patterns in dryland vegetation patches	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS			English	Article						canopy; Dry Chaco woodlands; forest; rainfall intensity; rangelands; spatial heterogeneity; water balance	SEMIARID WOODLAND; PRECIPITATION PULSES; SOLAR-RADIATION; DRY SUBTROPICS; SOIL-WATER; EROSION; HETEROGENEITY; ECOSYSTEMS; CONNECTIVITY; INFILTRATION	Effectively managing net primary productivity in drylands for grazing and other uses depends on understanding how limited rainfall input is redistributed by runoff and runon among vegetation patches, particularly for patches that contrast between lesser and greater amounts of vegetation cover. Due in part to data limitations, ecohydrologists generally have focused on rainfall event size to characterize water redistribution processes. Here we use soil moisture data from a semiarid woodland to highlight how, when event size is controlled and runoff and interception are negligible at the stand scale, rainfall intensity drives the relationship between water redistribution and canopy and soil patch attributes. Horizontal water redistribution variability increased with rainfall intensity and differed between patches with contrasting vegetation cover. Sparsely vegetated patches gained relatively more water during lower intensity events, whereas densely vegetated ones gained relatively more water during higher intensity events. Consequently, range managers need to account for the distribution of rainfall event intensity, as well as event size, to assess the consequences of climate variability and change on net primary productivity. More generally; our results suggest that rainfall intensity needs to be considered in addition to event size to understand vegetation patch dynamics in drylands.

The aim was to develop chemical tools for the authentication of VOOs according to their geographical origin or protected designation of origin(PDO), as well as to detect the mislabeling of the provenance of VOOs, at the regional or national level, or the mislabeling of non-PDO oils as PDO VOOs. The relationship between stable isotope abundances of the VOOs and their unsaponifiable fractions and the latitude of the VOO geographical origin was confirmed, but these criteria were not completely discriminant to differentiate VOOs according to their geographical origin. However, delta H-2 and/or delta C-13 data provided complementary geographical information to H-1-NMR data in the PLS-DA binary classification models afforded for VOOs from Greece, Spain, Italy, Izmir (Turkey), Crete (Greece), and the PDOs Riviera Ligure (Italy) and Huile d'olive d'Aix-en-Provence (France). H-2/H-1 and C-13/C-12 ratios of the unsaponifiable fractions of VOOs are reported here for the first time. The present approach for PDO Riviera Ligure VOOs, based on H-1-NMR data and C isotope abundance of the bulk oil and its unsaponifiable fraction, outperformed the previously reported classification models. Moreover, the PLS-DA models to authenticate VOOs from Greece and detect non-Greek VOOs achieved over 93% of correct predictions.

Geochemistry of Precordillera serpentinites, western Argentina: evidence for multistage hydrothermal alteration and tectonic implications for the Neoproterozoic-early Paleozoic	GEOLOGICA ACTA			English	Article						Mafic-ultramafic belt; Mid-ocean ridge; Listvenites; Cuyania terrane; Chilenia terrane	LAS TUNAS BELT; ULTRAMAFIC ROCKS; FRONTAL CORDILLERA; GUARGUARAZ COMPLEX; SOUTH-AMERICA; EVOLUTION; SPINEL; MARGIN; TEMPERATURE; PERIDOTITES	Serpentinites are a powerful tool to evaluate mantle composition and subsequent alteration processes during their tectonic emplacement. Exposures of this type of rocks can be found in the Argentine Precordillera (Cuyania terrane) and Frontal Cordillera, both located in central-western Argentina, within the Central Andes. In these regions a Neoproterozoic to Devonian mafic-ultramafic belt composed of serpentinites, metabasaltic dikes/sills, pillow lavas (with an Enriched to Normal Mid-Ocean Ridge Basalts (E- to N-MORB) geochemical signature) and mafic granulites crop out, spatially associated with marine metasedimentary rocks. The serpentinite bodies consist of lizardite/chrysotile+brucite+magnetite, with scarce pentlandite and anhedral reddish-brown Cr-spinel (picotite, pleonaste and spinel sensu stricto) as relict magmatic phases. The original peridotites were moderately-depleted harzburgites (ultramafic cumulates) with an intermediate chemical signature between a mid-ocean ridge and an arc-related ophiolite. Whole-rock Rare Earth Elements (REE) patterns of serpentinites exhibit enriched REE patterns ((La/Yb)CN=13-59) regarding CI chondrite with positive Eu anomalies. These features are the result of an interaction between hydrothermal fluid and serpentinites, in which moderate temperature (350 degrees-400 degrees C), CO2-rich, mildly basic hydrothermal fluid was involved and was responsible for the addition of Ca, Sr and REE to serpentinites. The presence of listvenites (silica-carbonate rocks) in the serpentinite margins allow us to infer another fluid metasomatism, where low-temperatures (<250 degrees C), highly-oxidized, highly-acid fluid lead to the precipitation of silica. The association of these metasomatized serpentinite bodies with neoproterozoic continental margin sucessions and MORB magmatism at the suture zone of the Cuyania and Chilenia terranes suggests the development of an oceanic basin between them during the Neoproterozoic-early Paleozoic.

J	Pirola, CJ; Sookoian, S				Pirola, Carlos J.; Sookoian, Silvia			The Dual and Opposite Role of the TM6SF2-rs58542926 Variant in Protecting Against Cardiovascular Disease and Conferring Risk for Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver: A Meta-analysis	HEPATOLOGY			English	Article							GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION; SUPERFAMILY MEMBER 2; METABOLIC SYNDROME; TM6SF2 VARIANT; HEART-DISEASE; ATHEROSCLEROSIS; SUSCEPTIBILITY; NAFLD; SEVERITY; CHINESE	The aim of this work was to estimate the strength of the effect of the TM6SF2 E167K (rs58542926 C/T) variant on blood lipid traits and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) across different populations. We performed a systematic review by a meta-analysis; literature searches identified 10 studies. The rs58542926 exerts a significant role in modulating lipid traits, including total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglycerides (TG), and NAFLD. However, this influence on lipids and NAFLD is opposite between genotypes in the dominant model of inheritance. Pooled estimates of random effects in 101,326 individuals showed that carriers of the minor T allele (EK1KK individuals), compared with subjects homozygous for the ancestral C allele (EE genotype), are protected from cardiovascular disease (CVD), showing lower levels of TC, LDL-C, and TG; the differences in mean 6 standard error (mg/dL) are -8.38 +/- 1.56, -3.7 +/- 0.9, and -9.4 +/- 2.1, respectively. The rs58542926 variant was not associated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in a large sample (n = 91,937). In contrast, carriers of the T allele showed a moderate effect on the risk of NAFLD (odds ratio: 2.13; 95% confidence interval: 1.36-3.30; P = 0.0009; n = 3273) and approximately similar to 2.2% higher lipid fat content when compared with homozygous EE (n = 3,413). Conclusions: The rs58542926 appears to be an important modifier of blood lipid traits in different populations. As a challenge for personalized medicine, the C-allele, which has an overall frequency as high as 93%, is associated with higher blood lipids, whereas the T allele confers risk for NAFLD; in turn, CVD and NAFLD are strongly related outcomes. Although the variant confers protection against CVD at the expense of an increased risk of NAFLD, it does not explain the link between these two complex diseases.

Edible kefiran films as vehicle for probiotic microorganisms	INNOVATIVE FOOD SCIENCE & EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Edible films; Functional food; Probiotics; Prebiotics	LACTIC-ACID BACTERIA; PHYSICAL-PROPERTIES; ANTILISTERIAL; PRODUCTS; YEASTS; GRAINS	In the presented work, we have developed edible kefiran films containing Lactobacillus plantarum CIDCA 8327 and Kluyveromyces marxianus CIDCA 8154. Thickness, moisture content and optical properties of films were not altered by the incorporation of microorganisms. During the film obtaining, lactobacillus concentration decreased one logarithmic cycle and no loss on yeast viability was detected. Both microorganisms included in glycerol plasticized kefiran films successfully maintained their viability during storage. After 35 days at 20 degrees degrees C L. plantarum viability decreased less than 13 logarithmic cycles and K. marxianus 0.7 logarithmic cycles. The high susceptibility of free cells of lactobacilli to acid was slightly diminished by the inclusion in the kefiran matrix. Inclusion of K. marxianus CIDCA 8154 significantly improved their survival to the sequential acid-bile treatment (36.3%) compared with the corresponding free cells (8.7%). The obtained edible kefiran films have great potential as an alternative way for probiotic delivery. Industrial relevance: The edible kefiran films containing probiotics presented in this manuscript are interesting matrices for probiotic administration since the neutral polysaccharide kefiran, produced by lactic acid bacteria, has health-promoting properties itself. Films can be obtained simply and inexpensively. They are transparent, thin and have good mechanical properties among those constituted by biomacromolecules. Likewise, kefiran films can preserve the viability of probiotics in non-refrigerated conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Pharmacokinetic comparison of different flubendazole formulations in pigs: A further contribution to its development as a macrofilaricide molecule	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PARASITOLOGY-DRUGS AND DRUG RESISTANCE			English	Article						Flubendazole; Systemic exposure; Pharmaceutical preparations; Cyclodextrins	HYDROXYPROPYL-BETA-CYCLODEXTRIN; DISPOSITION KINETICS; HAEMONCHUS-CONTORTUS; ALBENDAZOLE; SHEEP; BIOAVAILABILITY; EFFICACY; METABOLISM; FILARIASIS; IVERMECTIN	Despite the well established ivermectin activity against microfilaria, the success of human filariasis control programmes requires the use of a macrofilaricide compound. Different in vivo trials suggest that flubendazole (FLBZ), an anthelmintic benzimidazole compound, is a highly efficacious and potent macrofilaricide. However, since serious injection site reactions were reported in humans after the subcutaneous FLBZ administration, the search for alternative pharmaceutical strategies to improve the systemic availability of FLBZ has acquired special relevance both in human and veterinary medicine. The goal of the current experimental work was to compare the pharmacokinetic plasma behavior of FLBZ, and its metabolites, formulated as either an aqueous hydroxypropyl- beta -cyclodextrin-solution (HPBCD), an aqueous carboxymethyl cellulose-suspension (CMC) or a Tween 80-based formulation, in pigs. Animals were allocated into three groups and treated (2 mg/kg) with FLBZ formulated as either a HPBCD-solution (oral), CMC-suspension (oral) or Tween 80-based formulation (subcutaneous). Only trace amounts of FLBZ parent drug and its reduced metabolite were measured after administration of the different FLBZ formulations in pigs. The hydrolyzed FLBZ (H-FLBZ) metabolite was the main analyte recovered in the bloodstream in pigs treated with the three experimental FLBZ formulations. The oral administration of the HPBCD-solution accounted for significantly higher (P < 0.05) Cmax and AUC (23.1 +/- 4.4 mu g h/mL) values for the main metabolite (H-FLBZ), compared with those observed for the oral CMC-suspension (AUC = 3.5 +/- 1.0 mu g h/mL) and injectable Tween 80-based formulation (AUC: 7.5 +/- 1.7 mu g h/mL). The oral administration of the HPBCD-solution significantly improved the poor absorption pattern (indirectly assessed as the H-FLBZ plasma concentrations) observed after the oral administration of the FLBZ-CMC suspension or the subcutaneous injection of the Tween 80 FLBZ formulation to pigs. Overall, the work reported here indicates that FLBZ pharmacokinetic behavior can be markedly changed by the pharmaceutical formulation. (C) 2015 The Authors.

A variational Ritz formulation for vibration analysis of thick quadrilateral laminated plates	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Thick plates; Quadrilateral plates; Ritz method; Free vibration	SHEAR DEFORMATION-THEORY; GENERAL BOUNDARY-CONDITIONS; RADIAL BASIS FUNCTIONS; ORDER REFINED THEORY; COMPOSITE PLATES; SANDWICH PLATES; RECTANGULAR-PLATES; ORTHOGONAL POLYNOMIALS; CYLINDRICAL-SHELLS; FOURIER SOLUTION	In the present study, a variational Ritz approach for vibration analysis of thick arbitrarily quadrilateral laminated plates, based on the trigonometric shear deformation theory (TSDT) is developed. In this theory, shear stresses are vanished at the top and bottom surfaces of the laminate and shear correction factors are no longer required. A general straight-sided quadrilateral domain is mapped into a square domain in the computational space using a four-node master plate, employing a geometric transformation. The displacement field components are approximated by sets of beam characteristic orthogonal polynomials generated using the Gram-Schmidt procedure. The use of Ritz method allows a high spectral accuracy and faster convergence rates than local methods such as finite element. The algorithm developed is quite general, free of shear locking and can be used to obtain natural frequencies and modal shapes of laminated plates having various material parameters, geometrical planforms, length-to-thickness ratios and any combinations of free, simply supported and clamped edge support conditions. Through several numerical examples, the capability, efficiency and accuracy of the formulation are demonstrated. Convergence studies and comparison with other existing solutions in the literature suggest that the present algorithm is robust and computationally efficient. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Leukotriene C4 increases the susceptibility of adult mice to Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli infection	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article						Leukotriene C4; STEC; Shiga toxin; hemolytic uremic syndrome	INTESTINAL EPITHELIAL-CELLS; HEMOLYTIC-UREMIC SYNDROME; CYSTEINYL LEUKOTRIENES; MAST-CELLS; EXPRESSION; DISEASE; PATHOGENESIS; VIRULENCE; RECEPTOR; O157-H7	Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) is a food-borne pathogen that causes hemorrhagic colitis. Under some circumstances, Shiga toxin (Stx) produced within the intestinal tract enters the bloodstream, leading to systemic complications that may cause the potentially fatal hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS). Despite STEC human infection is characterized by acute inflammation of the colonic mucosa, little is known regarding the role of proinflammatory mediators like cysteine leukotrienes (cysLTs) in this pathology. Thus, the aim of this work was to analyze whether leukotriene C4 (LTC4) influences STEC pathogenesis in mice. We report that exogenous LTC4 pretreatment severely affected the outcome of STEC gastrointestinal infection. LTC4-pretreated (LTC4+) and STEC-infected (STEC+) mice showed an increased intestinal damage by histological studies, and a decreased survival compared to LTC4-non-pretreated (LTC4-) and STEC+ mice. LTC4+/STEC+ mice that died after the infection displayed neutrophilia and high urea levels, indicating that the cause of death was related to Stx2-toxicity. Despite the differences observed in the survival between LTC4+ and LTC4- mice after STEC infection, both groups showed the same survival after Stx2-intravenous inoculation. In addition, LTC4 pretreatment increased the permeability of mucosal intestinal barrier, as assessed by FITC-dextran absorption experiments. Altogether these results suggest that LTC4 detrimental effect on STEC infection is related to the increased passage of pathogenic factors to the bloodstream. Finally, we showed that STEC infection per se increases the endogenous LTC4 levels in the gut, suggesting that this inflammatory mediator plays a role in the pathogenicity of STEC infection in mice, mainly by disrupting the mucosal epithelial barrier.

For functions comprising two trophic levels, trait matching between interacting partners should also drive functioning. However, the predictive ability of trait diversity and matching is unclear for most functions, particularly for crop pollination, where interacting partners did not necessarily co-evolve. World-wide, we collected data on traits of flower visitors and crops, visitation rates to crop flowers per insect species and fruit set in 469 fields of 33 crop systems. Through hierarchical mixed-effects models, we tested whether flower visitor trait diversity and/or trait matching between flower visitors and crops improve the prediction of crop fruit set (functioning) beyond flower visitor species diversity and abundance. Flower visitor trait diversity was positively related to fruit set, but surprisingly did not explain more variation than flower visitor species diversity. The best prediction of fruit set was obtained by matching traits of flower visitors (body size and mouthpart length) and crops (nectar accessibility of flowers) in addition to flower visitor abundance, species richness and species evenness. Fruit set increased with species richness, and more so in assemblages with high evenness, indicating that additional species of flower visitors contribute more to crop pollination when species abundances are similar.Synthesis and applications. Despite contrasting floral traits for crops world-wide, only the abundance of a few pollinator species is commonly managed for greater yield. Our results suggest that the identification and enhancement of pollinator species with traits matching those of the focal crop, as well as the enhancement of pollinator richness and evenness, will increase crop yield beyond current practices. Furthermore, we show that field practitioners can predict and manage agroecosystems for pollination services based on knowledge of just a few traits that are known for a wide range of flower visitor species.

J	Tomba, JP				Tomba, J. Pablo			Teaching Thermodynamics of Ideal Solutions: An Entropy-Based Approach To Help Students Better Understand and Appreciate the Subtleties of Solution Models	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL EDUCATION			English	Article						Upper-Division Undergraduate; Graduate Education/Research; Physical Chemistry; Chemical Engineering; Materials Science; Thermodynamics	POLYMER-SOLUTIONS; EXPRESSION	The thermodynamic formalism of ideal solutions is developed in most of the textbooks postulating a form for the chemical potential of a generic component, which is adapted from the thermodynamics of ideal gas mixtures. From this basis, the rest of useful thermodynamic properties can be derived straightforwardly without further hypothesis. Although formally elegant, this approach to ideal solutions does not allow appreciation of subtle concepts embodied in the model such as requirements of molecular size and shape or the fact that equations that contain the universal gas constant (R) can be applied to describe liquid or solid solutions. As alternative, it is discussed here an approach centered on the behavior of the partial molar entropy of the component using the framework provided by the concept of accessible volume. It is shown that this way of presenting the topic allows a more natural flow and, particularly, analytical justification of all the hypothesis and ideas behind many fundamental solution models, including that of ideal solutions, with the extra advantage that it can almost entirely carried out from a macroscopic point of view.

Confocal Raman spectroscopy: In vivo biochemical changes in the human skin by topical formulations under UV radiation	JOURNAL OF PHOTOCHEMISTRY AND PHOTOBIOLOGY B-BIOLOGY			English	Article						Confocal Raman; Human skin; Mycosporine-like amino adds; Gadusol; Urocanic acid; UV radiation	EXCISED HUMAN SKIN; UROCANIC ACID; AMINO-ACIDS; BIOLOGICAL TISSUES; BLOCK-COPOLYMERS; AQUEOUS-SOLUTION; STRATUM-CORNEUM; ULTRAVIOLET-B; ATR-FTIR; MICROSPECTROSCOPY	A new approach to the study of the effects on human skin of mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) and gadusol (Gad) incorporated in polymer gel is proposed in this work. The depth profile and photoprotector effects of Pluronic F127 (R) gels containing each of the natural actives were evaluated by in vivo confocal Raman spectroscopy aiming at the analysis of the biochemical changes on human skin. Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) showed that the data corresponding to different depths of the skin, from surface to 4 mu m, and from 6 to 16 mu m, remained in the same cluster. In vivo Raman spectra, classified into five different layers of epidermis according to their similarities, indicated that the amount of Gad gel increased by about 26% in the outermost layer of the stratum corneum (SC) and that MAAs gel at 2 mu m depth was 103.4% higher than in the outermost layer of the SC. Variations in the SC of urocanic acid at 1490-1515 cm(-1) and 1652 cm(-1) and histidine at 1318 cm(-1) were calculated, before and after UV exposure with or without gels. With the application of gels the vibrational modes that correspond to lipids in trans conformation (1063 and 1128 cm(-1)) increased with respect to normal skin, whereas gauche conformation (1085 cm(-1)) disappeared. Our studies suggest that gels protected the skin against the stress of the natural defense mechanism caused by high levels of UV exposure. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Tosato, M.

Scavenging of photogenerated ROS by Oxicams. Possible biological and environmental implications	JOURNAL OF PHOTOCHEMISTRY AND PHOTOBIOLOGY B-BIOLOGY			English	Article						Oxicams; Photodegradation; Photoprotection; Photosensitization; Riboflavin; ROS	NONSTEROIDAL ANTIINFLAMMATORY DRUGS; MOLECULAR-OXYGEN; SINGLET OXYGEN; RATE CONSTANTS; PHOTOSENSITIZED OXIDATION; PHOTOCHEMICAL FATE; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; ELECTRON-TRANSFER; ASCORBIC-ACID; AMINO-ACIDS	The profusely employed drugs Piroxicam (Piro), Tenoxicam (Teno) and Meloxicam (Melo) belonging to the nonsteroidal andinflammatory drug (NSAID) family of the Oxicams (Oxis) were studied in the frame of two specific conditions: (a) their ROS scavenging ability, in relation to a possible biological antioxidant action and (b) their photodegradability under environmental conditions, in the context of Oxi-contaminated waters. Singlet molecular oxygen (O-2((1)Delta(g))) and superoxide radical anion (O-2(center dot-)) were photogenerated through Riboflavin (Rf, vitamin B2)-photosensitization in aqueous and aqueous-methanolic solutions in the presence of Oxi concentrations in the range 50-500 mu M. The visible-light absorber vitamin is currently present in all types of natural waters and constitutes the most frequent endogenous photosensitizer in mammals. Hence, it was employed in order to mimic both natural sceneries of interest. All three Oxis quench O-2((1)Delta(g)) with rate constants in the order of 10(8) M-1 S-1 showing a significant photodegradation efficiency given by a dominant reactive fashion for deactivation of the oxidative species. Although this is not a desirable property in the context of photoprotection upon prolonged photoirradiation, constitutes in fact a promissory aspect for the degradation NSAIDs, in waste waters. Indirect evidence indicates that Melo is also oxidized through a O-2(center dot-)-mediated component. The simultaneous presence of Piro plus tryptophan or tyrosine under Rf-photosensitizing conditions, which has taken the amino acids as photooxidizable model residues in a proteinaceous environment, indicates that the NSAID induces a protection of the biomolecules against photodynamic degradation.

Although, it was demonstrated that riboflavin is an efficient photosensitizer for PDT, the effect of its ester derivate, riboflavin 2',3',4',5'-tetraacetate (RFTA), which has higher cellular uptake, has not been well defined. To evaluate the cell death generated by applying RFTA as the photosensitizer in PDT in a human cancer cell line of squamous carcinoma (SCC-13), these cells were incubated with riboflavin and its ester derivate, RFTA followed by irradiation with different blue light doses. Cell viability was evaluated using neutral red uptake assay and cell death was evaluated using transmission electron microscopy, TUNEL assay and annexinV-PE/7AAD double staining. The expression of caspase-3, Bax, Bcl-2, ERR 1/2 and p38(MAPK) was evaluated by Western blotting and generation of intracellular ROS and changes in anion superoxide levels were analyzed using 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein-diacetate and dihydroethidium dye, respectively. RFTA-PDT generated a decrease in cancer cell viability in a light dose-response. Treated SCC-13 cells exhibited chromatin condensation, formation of apoptotic bodies, increases in TUNEL-positive cells, phosphatidylserine externalization and decreased procaspase-3 and Bcl-2 protein expression and increment of ERK 1/2 phosphorylation. Moreover, trolox abolished the effect of PDT on cell viability linking the increase in intracellular ROS levels with the cell death observed, whereas that the pre-treatment with MEK inhibitor did not induce changes in SCC-13 cell survival. These findings demonstrate the effects of RFTA in triggering apoptosis induced by ROS ((center dot)\O-2(-))) production after visible light irradiation of squamous carcinoma cells.

In this work, we have investigated the ability of pterin, the parent compound of aromatic pterins, to photosensitize the oxidation of histidine in aqueous solutions under UV-A irradiation. Histidine is an alpha-amino acid with an imidazole functional group, and is frequently present at the active sites of enzymes. The results highlight the role of the pH in controlling the competition between energy and electron transfer mechanisms. It has been previously demonstrated that pterins participate as sensitizers in photosensitized oxidations, both by type I (electron-transfer) and type II mechanisms (singlet oxygen (O-1(2))). By combining different analytical techniques, we could establish that a type I photooxidation was the prevailing mechanism at acidic pH, although a type II mechanism is also present, but it is more important in alkaline solutions.

A quick and effective estimation of algal density by turbidimetry developed with Chlorella vulgaris cultures	LIMNETICA			English	Article						Chlorella vulgaris; culture; turbidimetry; cell counting digital analysis; homogenization	LIGHT-EMITTING-DIODES; BIODIESEL PRODUCTION; POPULATION-GROWTH; MICROALGAE; CULTIVATION; ROTIFERS; WASTE	The use of Chlorella vulgaris Beijerinck as a food source for zooplankton requires the optimization of algal-culture conditions for prolonged growth maintenance. In this study, we developed a method that relates algal density to culture turbidity to estimate culture biomass. This method was improved by applying digital analysis for algal counting, which promotes accuracy, low culture disturbance, easy repetition and the rapid acquisition of results. Two 3-L cultures of C. vulgaris, maintained for two weeks with continuous lighting (eight light-emitting diodes at 50 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1), at 660 nm) and aerators to prevent algal sedimentation, reached turbidities of 214 and 280 NTUs, respectively. Sample counting was performed using digital images obtained with an inverted microscope. Aliquot sedimentation was compared with or without previous homogenization through photographs taken in the central, middle, and peripheral sectors of the Utermohl settling chambers. For each procedure, we counted between 17 and 404 individuals image(-1), requiring, on average, one minute image. At low turbidity (<40 NTU), the data dispersion was similar between the two protocols (error range, 16 to 60 %); at higher turbidity, the direct sedimentation alone gave a larger error (31-50 %) than with prior homogenization (5-13 %). Regression analysis at low data fit (67 %) suggested that the sedimentation heterogeneity of non-homogenized samples corresponded to a pattern of settled algae having increasing density from the periphery to the centre of the chamber, but with homogenization, a better model fitting (99 %) resulted, contributing to greater consistency with that procedure. We consider that this turbidometric protocol could be used successfully with cultures of algae that have geometrical shapes recognizable by the image software.

Homology of the chiropteran "dactylopatagium" brevis	MAMMALIAN BIOLOGY			English	Article						Bats; Wing development; Propatagium; Homology; Musculature	LIMB DIVERSIFICATION; BAT FLIGHT; MAMMALIA; PTEROPODIDAE; PHYLOGENY	Bats possess a series of patagial tracts that together act as an aerofoil for powered flight. Here we discuss the homology of a small portion of the patagium, the brevis section, traditionally assigned as a part of the handwing (dactilopatagium). Using dissected specimens and literature references we show that the muscle occipitopollicalis, a morphological marker of the propatagium, extends into the brevis section in a variety of bats. This led us to conclude that the brevis section is in fact a part of the propatagium, which is also supported by developmental evidence. (C) 2015 Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Saugetierkunde.

Although low density in species with large range sizes has been associated with large body size, this is not the case for fairy armadillos. We propose that past climate variations may have caused their current low densities, and evaluate retractions and expansions of suitable areas of fairy armadillos by extrapolating the consensus of habitat suitability models fitted with current climatic conditions to past conditions. We found great variation in suitable area along time in both species, with a drastic reduction in the Last Interglacial (LIG) period when compared with current situation. Both the variations and the reduction during LIG were more pronounced in Calyptophractus than in Chlamyphorus. We postulate that past extreme reductions in suitable areas could cause a delay in the recovery of the populations, resulting in low densities despite climatic conditions during more benign times allowing a more widespread distribution.

In the present study, we designed a competitive internal amplification control (IAC) to be included in a well-known PCR protocol used to amplify the stx1 and stx2 genes from STEC isolates. The IAC was introduced in the PCR reaction and amplified when E. coli O157:H7 cultures and contaminated pediatric feces were assayed. When STEC concentration was 10(3) CFU ml(-1) in pure culture and 10(4) CFU g(-1), in contaminated stools, the IAC at concentration of 0.143 pg mu l(-1) in the PCR reaction mixture was co-amplified with the stx2 sequence, producing bands of 279 and 349 bp, respectively. These STEC values were considered the detection limits of the duplex PCR. The specific detection of STEC by duplex PCR including IAC might be achieved directly on pediatric feces when the pathogen load reaches concentrations of at least 10(4) CPU g(-1).

How NLR receptors respond to pathogens is inadequately understood. We previously reported single-residue mutations that expand the response of the potato immune receptor R3a to AVR3a(EM), a stealthy effector from the late blight oomycete pathogen Phytophthora infestans. I2, another NLR that mediates resistance to the wilt-causing fungus Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici, is the tomato ortholog of R3a. We transferred previously identified R3a mutations to I2 to assess the degree to which the resulting I2 mutants have an altered response. We discovered that wild-type I2 protein responds weakly to AVR3a. One mutant in the N-terminal coiled-coil domain, I2(I141N), appeared sensitized and displayed markedly increased response to AVR3a. Remarkably, I2(I141N) conferred partial resistance to P. infestans. Further, I2(I141N) has an expanded response spectrum to F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici effectors compared with the wild-type I2 protein. Our results suggest that synthetic immune receptors can be engineered to confer resistance to phylogenetically divergent pathogens and indicate that knowledge gathered for one NLR could be exploited to improve NLR from other plant species.

Rat cells (ADIPO-P2 cell line, derived from Sprague-Dawley rat adipose cells) were treated with a single concentration of STZ (2 mM). Chromosomal aberrations were analyzed 18 h, 10 days, and 15 days after treatment, using PNA-FISH with a pan-telomeric probe [Cy3-(CCCTAA)(3)] to detect (TTAGGG)n repeats. Cytogenetic analysis revealed a higher frequency of chromosomal aberrations in STZ-exposed cultures vs. untreated cultures at each time point analyzed. The yield of induced aberrations was very similar at each time point. Induction of aberrations not involving telomere dysfunction was only observed 18 h and 15 days after treatment, whereas induction of telomere dysfunction-related aberrations by STZ (mainly in the form of telomere FISH signal loss and duplications, most of them chromatid-type aberrations) was observed at each time point. Our results show that STZ induces persistent telomere instability in mammalian cells, cytogenetically manifested as telomere dysfunction-related chromosomal aberrations. Neither telomere length nor telomerase activity is related to the telomere dysfunction. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Effect of alendronate on the mandible and long bones: an experimental study in vivo	PEDIATRIC RESEARCH			English	Article							NITROGEN-CONTAINING BISPHOSPHONATES; GROWING RAT BONE; OSTEOGENESIS IMPERFECTA; MOUSE MODEL; CHILDREN; PAMIDRONATE; GROWTH; OSTEOPOROSIS; CLODRONATE; RESORPTION	BACKGROUND: Bisphosphonates are anticatabolic agents that inhibit bone resorption and are widely used to treat osteoporosis and bone metastases in adults. They are also used in young patients with diseases like osteogenesis imperfecta or juvenile osteoporosis. Bone modeling/remodeling is elevated in growing subjects, and inhibition of osteoclastic activity has been shown to interfere with growth. Thus, our objective was to evaluate the effect of alendronate (ALN) on growing animals. METHODS: Healthy male Wistar rats, aged 1 mo, received ALN or vehicle for 8 wk. Serum levels (calcemia, phosphatemia, and total alkaline phosphatase) were determined. Morphometric (rat: femur and tibia weight and length and hemimandible growth) and histomorphometric parameters (thickness of tibial epiphyseal cartilage and each cartilage zone, interradicular bone volume in the first lower molar, trabeculae volume, percentage of bone and cartilage, and osteoclast number in mandibular condyles) were assessed. RESULTS: ALN caused a significant decrease in femur and tibia length, tibial cartilage thickness, and longitudinal growth of hemimandibles. It increased interradicular bone volume and mandibular condyle trabeculae volume, increasing the percentage of cartilage and osteoclast number. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that administration of ALN to growing animals alters the endochondral ossification process, and thus alters growth.

But are only the activational and organizational hormonal effects to blame for such differences? Males and females not only differ in their sex (males are born with testes and females with ovaries) but also carry different sex chromosome complements and are thus influenced throughout life by different genomes. In this review, we discuss our recent studies in order to evaluate whether sex chromosome complement is in part responsible for gender differences previously observed in ANG II bradycardic-baroreflex response and sodium depletion-induced sodium appetite and neural activity. To test the hypothesis that XX or XY contributes to the dimorphic ANG II bradycardic-baroreflex response, we used the four core genotype mouse model, in which the effects of gonadal sex (testes or ovaries) and sex chromosome complement (XX or XY) are dissociated. The results indicate that ANG II bradycardic-baroreflex sexual dimorphic response may be ascribed to differences in sex chromosomes, indicating an XX-sex chromosome complement facilitatory bradycardic-baroreflex control of heart rate. Furthermore, we evaluated whether genetic differences within the sex chromosome complement may differentially modulate the known sexually dimorphic sodium appetite as well as basal or induced brain activity due to physiological stimulation of the renin-angiotensin system by furosemide and low-sodium treatment. Our studies demonstrate an organizational hormonal effect on sexually dimorphic induced sodium intake in mice, while at the brain level (subfornical organ and area postrema) we showed a sex chromosome complement effect in sodium-depleted mice, suggesting a sex chromosome gene participation in the modulation of neural pathways underlying regulatory response to renin-angiotensin stimulation.

Biochemical characterization of a novel carboxypeptidase inhibitor from a variety of Andean potatoes	PHYTOCHEMISTRY			English	Article						Andean potatoes; Solanum tuberosum; Solanaceae; Plant protease inhibitor; Potato carboxypeptidase inhibitor; Secondary binding site	EPIDERMAL-GROWTH-FACTOR; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; SUBSTRATE-SPECIFICITY; PROTEINASE-INHIBITORS; PROTEOLYTIC-ENZYMES; SEQUENCE; DATABASE; MECHANISM; PROTEASE; BINDING	Natural protease inhibitors of metallocarboxypeptidases are rarely reported. In this work, the cloning, expression and characterization of a proteinaceous inhibitor of the A/B-type metallocarboxypeptidases, naturally occurring in tubers of Solanum tuberosum, subsp. andigenum cv. Imilla morada, are described. The obtained cDNA encoded a polypeptide of 80 residues, which displayed the features of metallocarboxypeptidase inhibitor precursors from the Potato Carboxypeptidase Inhibitor (PCI) family. The mature polypeptide (39 residues) was named imaPCI and in comparison with the prototype molecule of the family (PCI from S. tuberosum subsp. tuberosum), its sequence showed one difference at its N-terminus and another three located at the secondary binding site, a region described to contribute to the stabilization of the complex inhibitor-target enzyme. In order to gain insights into the relevance of the secondary binding site in nature, a recombinant form of imaPCI (rimaPCI) having only differences at the secondary binding site with respect to recombinant PCI (rPCI) was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The rimaPCI exhibited a molecular mass of 4234.8 Da by MALDI-TOF/MS. It displayed potent inhibitory activity towards A/B-type carboxypeptidases (with a Ki in the nanomolar range), albeit 2-4-fold lower inhibitory capacity compared to its counterpart rPCI. This result is in agreement with our bioinformatic analysis, which showed that the main interaction established between the secondary binding site of rPCI and the bovine carboxypeptidase A is likely lost in the case of rimaPCI. These observations reinforce the importance of the secondary binding site of PCI-family members on inhibitory effects towards A/B-type metallocarboxypeptidases. Furthermore, as a simple proof of concept of its applicability in biotechnology and biomedicine, the ability of rimaPCI to protect human epidermal growth factor from C-terminal cleavage and inactivation by carboxypeptidases A and B was demonstrated.

Activity of NA(+)/H+ exchangers alters aquaporin-mediated water transport in human placenta	PLACENTA			English	Article						AQPs; NHEs; Water transport; pHi	NA+/H+ EXCHANGER; INTRACELLULAR PH; EXPRESSION; SYNCYTIOTROPHOBLAST; MEMBRANE; CHANNEL; AQP9; H+	The intracellular pH (pHi) of syncytiotrophoblasts is regulated, in part, by Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE)-1, NHE-2, and NHE-3. Failures in pHi homeostasis could alter critical cellular functions such as water transport and cell volume. Here, we evaluated whether alterations in syncytiotrophoblast pHi could modify water uptake mediated by aquaporins (AQPs) and the contribution of NHEs to this mechanism. We showed that changes in syncytiotrophoblast pHi did not affect water uptake in the presence of functional NHEs. However, inhibition of NHEs alters transcellular water transport mediated by AQPs in acidosis. These results suggest an interaction between placental AQPs and NHEs in the regulation of water uptake during acidotic states. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A Survey on Occurrence of Cladosporium fulvum Identifies Race 0 and Race 2 in Tomato-Growing Areas of Argentina	PLANT DISEASE			English	Article							AVIRULENCE GENE AVR9; DISEASE RESISTANCE; ALLELIC VARIATION; PASSALORA-FULVA; PLANT-PATHOGEN; CF-4 LOCUS; LEAF MOLD; PROTEINS; DIVERSITY; MARKERS	The presence of Cladosporium fulvum (syn. Passalora fulva), causal agent of tomato leaf mold, was confirmed in the two main greenhouse-production areas for tomato in Argentina. Using both morphological characters and internal transcribed spacer sequencing, we confirmed the presence of physiological races of this pathogen. A diagnostic multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was also developed, using primers derived from C. fulvum avirulence (Avr) genes. In all, 20 isolates of Cladosporium spp. were obtained as monospore cultures and 12 were identified as C. fulvum. By this method, we showed that, of these 12 isolates, 5 were race 0 (carrying functional Avr2, Avr4, Avr4E, and Avr9 genes) and 7 were race 2 (lacking the Avr2 gene). Race identity was confirmed by testing their virulence on a set of tomato differentials carrying different Cf resistance genes. All Avr genes could be amplified in single or multiplex PCR using DNA isolated from in vitro grown monospore cultures but only three Avr could be amplified when genomic DNA was isolated from C. fulvum-infected necrotic leaf tissue.

Previous studies showed that AsES causes the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that peaked 4 h post treatment (hpt), but due to the experimental approach used it was not clear whether the accumulation of ROS observed was intracellular or extracellular or took place as a single peak. By using a different experimental setup, a more complex early events associated to the activation of the innate immunity were observed. In this paper we report that strawberry plant cells treated with AsES exhibits a triphasic production of H2O2 and a rapid intracellular accumulation of NO. The first phase consists in a progressive extracellular accumulation of H2O2 that starts immediately after the treatment with AsES and is preceded by a rapid and transient cell membrane depolarization. During this phase takes place also a rapid intracellular accumulation of NO. Microscopic observations of mesophyll cells treated with AsES reveals that NO accumulates at the chloroplast. After the first extracellular H2O2 production phase, two intracellular H2O2 accumulation events occur, the first 2 hpt, and the second 7 hpt. Cells treated with AsES also show a transient increase of ion leakage, and a progressive alkalinization of the extracellular medium. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

In Argentina information about veterinary antimicrobial usage at herd level is still limited. The purpose of this study was to quantify antimicrobial usage at herd level of most used drugs to treat lactating cows (LC) and preweaned calves (PWC). Prevalence of diseases and antimicrobial drug usage in 18 milking herds and in 11 calves rearing units (CRUs) were assessed through a survey. Drug usage (DU) at herd level was estimated through a standardized indicator, the number of Defined Daily Doses Animal (DDDA) per year, considering a standardized body weight of 600 kg for LC and of 60 kg for PWC. Pearson correlation coefficients were estimated and used to evaluate the association of LC herd size and milk yield (kg/day) with each disease prevalence and with DU. Student t-Test was used to compare disease prevalence and DU with various management practices in CRUs. Clinical mastitis was the most prevalent disease followed by foot, uterine and respiratory diseases in adult dairy cows. More involvement of veterinarians in treatment decisions was observed in larger dairy herds. Most used antimicrobials were beta-lactams and aminoglycosides. Especially for intramammary compounds, there was a trend towards multidrug formulations. The median DU was 5.21 DDDA/LC/year (range = 2.88-10.88), the intramammary usage for clinical mastitis (IM-CM) and dry cow therapy (IM-DRY), representing 85.4% of total drug usage. No significant correlations were observed between herd size or milk yield with disease prevalence and with DU for all considered uses (IM-CM, IM-DRY and parental (PAR)). Enteritis was reported in all CRUs, followed by respiratory disease (91%), and omphalophlebitis (3%). The median DU for all drugs used at CRU level was 0.49 DDDA/PWC/year. Prevalences and DU for treatment of enteritis and respiratory diseases did not differ significantly between rearing systems, colostrum management or permanence time of the calf with the mother after birth. Although it was possible to estimate the drug usage at farm level, it was observed that the diversity of drug compounds and dose heterogeneity presented by the various manufacturers made the calculation of those indicators complex.

Participants were 318 college students (36.2% men; mean age = 20.9 years, SD = 6.4 years). The psychometric properties of this Spanish version were analyzed using the Rasch model, and the factor structure was examined using confirmatory factor analysis. The, verification of the global fit of the, data showed adequate indexes for persons and items. The reliability estimates were high for both items and persons. Differential item functioning across gender was 'found 'for 23 items, which likely reflects known differences in impulsivity levels between men and women. 'The factor structure of the Spanish version of the UPPS-P replicates previous work with the original UPPS-P Scale. Overall, results suggest that test scores from the Spanish version of the UPPS-P show adequate psychometric properties to accurately assess the, multidimensional model of impulsivity, which represents the most exhaustive measure of this construct.

The experimental groups were: G1 = RVA-specific IgY treatment; G2 = no Ab treatment; and G3 = colostrum deprived + no Ab treatment. IgY treatment significantly reduced virus shedding, diarrhea duration and severity compared to G2 and G3 calves. However, it caused a partial suppression of systemic Ab responses to RVA that could be associated with less severe diarrhea. The oral treatment with IgY for 7 days was associated with significantly higher antibody secreting cell responses in the calves compared with other groups of animals. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Bovine tuberculosis in domestic pigs: Genotyping and distribution of isolates in Argentina	RESEARCH IN VETERINARY SCIENCE			English	Article						Mycobacterium bovis; Pigs; Spoligotyping; VNTR	AVIUM SUBSP HOMINISSUIS; EUROPEAN WILD BOAR; MYCOBACTERIUM-BOVIS; SUS-SCROFA; EPIDEMIOLOGY; INFECTION; COMPLEX; DIVERSITY; DIAGNOSIS; ANIMALS	Bovine tuberculosis is caused by Mycobacterium bovis and affects primarily cattle, among many other mammal species. In this study, 250 isolates of M. bovis collected from pigs slaughtered in Argentina were typed by spoligotyping. Over half of the isolates (66%) grouped into two spoligotypes. Moreover, SB0140 was the most frequent spoligotype detected in the three performed samplings. In addition, 195 isolates were typed through variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) by selecting 7 loci (MIRU 16-26-31 and ETR A-B-C-D). The relationship among the patterns was performed using a goeBURST algorithm and the main clonal complexes grouped 110 isolates (56%). Although pigs shared genotypes with cattle (n = 21), some patterns were detected only in pigs (n = 14). These findings suggest the pig as a source of M. bovis infection to cattle.

Currently, it limits sunflower oil production in Southern and Eastern Europe and in some areas of Asia, causing around 50% seed losses when susceptible hybrids are grown. Covered in this review are aspects such as: biological processes that are common to Orobanche spp. and/or particular to O. cumana in sunflower, genetic resistance and its mechanisms, races of the parasite identified in different countries throughout the time and their increasing virulence, and breeding for resistance to some herbicides as a novel control option. The main purpose is to present an updated and, as far as possible, complete picture of the way both the parasitic weed and its host crop have evolved in time, and how they co-exist in the current agriculture. Additionally, we propose a system for determining the races of the parasite that can be internationally adopted from now. In the context of minimal harmful effects on the environment, changing patterns of land use in farming systems, and global environment changes, the final goal of this work is to provide all those interested in parasites from field crops and their integrated management compiled information on the sunflower - O. cumana system as a case study.

Use of geophysical survey as a predictor of the edaphic properties variability in soils used for livestock production	SPANISH JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH			English	Article							APPARENT ELECTRICAL-CONDUCTIVITY; ELECTROMAGNETIC INDUCTION; SPATIAL VARIABILITY; TEMPORAL PATTERNS; MANAGEMENT ZONES; DELINEATION; QUALITY; PASTURE; SENSORS	The spatial variability in soils used for livestock production (i.e. Natraquoll and Natraqualf) at farm and paddock scale is usually very high. Understanding this spatial variation within a field is the first step for site-specific crop management. For this reason, we evaluated whether apparent electrical conductivity (ECa), a widely used proximal soil sensing technology, is a potential estimator of the edaphic variability in these types of soils. ECa and elevation data were collected in a paddock of 16 ha. Elevation was negatively associated with ECa. Geo-referenced soil samples were collected and analyzed for soil organic matter (OM) content, pH, the saturation extract electrical conductivity (EC), available phosphorous (P), and anaerobically incubated Nitrogen (Nan). Relationships between soil properties and ECa were analyzed using regression analysis, principal components analysis (PCA), and stepwise regression. Principal components (PC) and the PC-stepwise were used to determine which soil properties have an important influence on ECa. In this experiment elevation was negatively associated with ECa. The data showed that pH, OM, and EC, exhibited a high correlation with ECa (R-2=0.76; 0.70 and 0.65, respectively). Whereas P and Nan showed a lower correlation (R-2=0.54 and 0.11 respectively). The model resulting from the PC-stepwise regression analysis explained slightly more than 69% of the total variation of the measured ECa, only retaining PC1. Therefore, EC pH and OM were considered key latent variables because they substantially influence the relationship between the PC I and the ECa (loading factors>0.4). Results showed that ECa is associated with the spatial distribution of some important soil properties. Thus, ECa can be used as a support tool to implement site-specific management in soils for livestock use.

In this context, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors comprise one type of the compounds most actively studied in the search for an effective treatment of symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. This work describes the isolation of a natural compound, solanocapsine, the preparation of its chemical derivatives, the evaluation of AChE inhibitory activity, and the structure-activity analysis of relevant cases. The influence of structural variations on the inhibitory potency was carefully investigated by modifying different reactive parts of the parent molecule. A theoretical study was also carried out into the binding mode of representative compounds to the enzyme through molecular modeling. The biological properties of the series were investigated. Through this study valuable information was obtained of steroidal alkaloid-type compounds as a starting point for the synthesis of AChE inhibitors. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

All nests (n = 202) were built on waxy-leaf nightshade (Solanum glaucophyllum) at 0.99 +/- 0.27 m above water level. The incubation period was 20-23 (21.71 +/- 1.57) days; laying and hatching took place on successive days. An average of 2.63 +/- 0.60 (Range = 2-4) opaque pale blue eggs were recorded per nest. Length, width and weight of eggs did not differ between seasons. Double (n = 43) and triple (n = 47) broods were recorded. A total of 631 eggs were monitored; no differences were detected in breeding, hatching, nesting, or fledging success between seasons. The time spent by chicks in the nest was 14.6 +/- 2.16 days, and the average number of chicks per nest was 2.15 +/- 0.55. Age-specific mortality rate for eggs was 22% and 38% and for chicks 47% and 35% for the first and second seasons, respectively. Sixty-one percent of nest failures were related to the disappearance of eggs or chicks from the nests, possibly due to predation or climatic factors.

Studies have reported the successful use of high-dose daptomycin (> 6 mg/kg/day) in patients with difficult-to-treat infections. The present analysis evaluated the effectiveness and safety of high doses (> 6 mg/kg/day) of daptomycin for the treatment of different Gram-positive infections. European Cubicin(A (R)) Outcomes Registry and Experience (EU-CORE) is a non-interventional, multicenter, retrospective, patient registry designed to collect real-world data from patients treated with daptomycin between 2006 and 2012. Clinical outcomes were assessed at the end of daptomycin treatment for three dose groups: a parts per thousand currency sign6, > 6 to < 8, and a parts per thousand yen8 mg/kg/day. Safety was assessed for up to 30 days post-daptomycin treatment. Of the 6075 patients enrolled in EU-CORE, 4892 patients received daptomycin doses a parts per thousand currency sign6 mg/kg/day, while 1097 patients received high doses (> 6 mg/kg/day). The primary infections with the largest proportion of patients treated with a high dose (> 6 mg/kg/day) were osteomyelitis (37.1%), foreign body/prosthetic infection (31.6%), and endocarditis (27.6%). S. aureus was identified in 42.9% of patients with positive cultures treated with either a parts per thousand currency sign6 or > 6 mg/kg/day. The overall clinical success rate was 82.0% (899/1097) with high doses (> 6 mg/kg/day) and 80.3% (3928/4890) with doses a parts per thousand currency sign6 mg/kg/day. Numerically higher clinical success rate was observed for endocarditis and foreign body/prosthetic infection, as well as for coagulase-negative staphylococcal and enterococcal infections, with high-dose daptomycin treatment. There were no new or unexpected safety findings at doses > 6 mg/kg/day. These results suggested that daptomycin at doses > 6 mg/kg/day was effective and well tolerated. High-dose daptomycin is a potential therapeutic option in patients with difficult-to-treat Gram-positive infections. This study was funded by Novartis Pharma AG.	[Seaton, R.

Due to their key importance, much research has been advocated to evaluate anthropogenic habitat loss and fragmentation effects on plant-antagonist interactions but no clear response patterns have arisen. Even recent quantitative reviews have failed to provide consistent generalizations. Here we conduct the first phylogenetically independent meta-analysis along with a traditional meta-analytical approach. We examined whether characteristics of the interaction, the fragmented landscape, and methodological approaches modulate the magnitude of effects. Traditional meta-analysis showed that plants within habitat fragments suffer on average less damage from antagonists. However, when incorporating the phylogenetic relationships among plants, the overall effect and the particular effects of moderators became non-significant. Interestingly, we found a strong and consistent trend between both meta-analytical approaches in the overall effect of habitat fragmentation on folivory elicited by insects. This implies the first genuine fragmentation effect that transcends the phylogeny of plants and is not undermined by statistical problems of pseudoreplication. Decreased insect folivory will favor certain plant species, especially those with acquisitive resource use traits such as pioneer and exotic invasive, thereby affecting plant community composition in fragmented habitats. Here, we highlight the importance of incorporating the phylogeny in meta-analytical contexts. Our results imply that current studies worldwide represent a phylogenetically-conserved sample of fragmentation effects on plant-antagonist interactions. Thus, more studies on distantly phylogenetically-related plants are needed to have a broader, more representative, sample of responses across angiosperms. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The environmental profile of a community's health: a cross-sectional study on tobacco marketing in 16 countries	BULLETIN OF THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION			English	Article							HIGH-INCOME COUNTRIES; ADOLESCENT SMOKING; PROMOTION; INDUSTRY; CIGARETTES; PRIORITIES; MIDDLE	Objective To examine and compare tobacco marketing in 16 countries while the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control requires parties to implement a comprehensive ban on such marketing. Methods Between 2009 and 2012, a kilometre-long walk was completed by trained investigators in 462 communities across 16 countries to collect data on tobacco marketing. We interviewed community members about their exposure to traditional and non-traditional marketing in the previous six months. To examine differences in marketing between urban and rural communities and between high-, middle- and low-income countries, we used multilevel regression models controlling for potential confounders. Findings Compared with high-income countries, the number of tobacco advertisements observed was 81 times higher in low-income countries (incidence rate ratio, IRR: 80.98; 95% confidence interval, CI: 4.15-1578.42) and the number of tobacco outlets was 2.5 times higher in both low-and lower-middle-income countries (IRR: 2.58; 95% CI: 1.17-5.67 and IRR: 2.52; CI: 1.23-5.17, respectively). Of the 11 842 interviewees, 1184(10%) reported seeing at least five types of tobacco marketing. Self-reported exposure to at least one type of traditional marketing was 10 times higher in low-income countries than in high-income countries (odds ratio, OR: 9.77; 95% CI: 1.24-76.77). For almost all measures, marketing exposure was significantly lower in the rural communities than in the urban communities. Conclusion Despite global legislation to limit tobacco marketing, it appears ubiquitous. The frequency and type of tobacco marketing varies on the national level by income group and by community type, appearing to be greatest in low-income countries and urban communities.

Correlation between Fusarium graminearum and Deoxynivalenol during the 2012/13 Wheat Fusarium Head Blight Outbreak in Argentina	CEREAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Fusarium graminearum; deoxynivalenol; Fusarium head blight; quantitative PCR	QUANTITATIVE DETECTION; SPECIES COMPLEX; GRAIN; QUANTIFICATION; MECHANISMS; NIVALENOL; PATHOGEN; CEREALS; TAQMAN; REGION	Fusarium graminearum (Schwabe) is reported as the main causal agent of Fusarium head blight in Argentina. The disease causes great losses in humid and semi-humid regions of the world, reducing grain yield and quality. During 2012/13 harvest season, a severe epidemic occurred in Argentina. The aims of this work were to determine the F. graminearum incidence and deoxynivalenol accumulation in wheat grain and flour samples obtained from two of the main wheat growing regions from Argentina. Levels of the pathogen and deoxynivalenol content were correlated in heads, grains and flour. Out of 69 wheat grain samples, 55 (79.7%) showed deoxynivalenol levels between 0.4 and 8.5 mu g/kg. Fusarium graminearum was the main species isolated, the isolation frequency ranged from 30 to 52% of the total grains analyzed. Correlations were observed between deoxynivalenol content, % of F. grami-nearum infection, presence of the pathogen in heads, grain and flour.

Drechs is an important foliar disease of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). From a set of phenotypically and molecularly characterized set of Argentinean isolates, two isolates H0019 and H0120 which do not correspond to known races of the pathogen were selected. Segregation for resistance among a set of recombinant inbred lines bred from the cross 'W7984' x cv. 'Opata 85' was used to identify the basis for resistance at the seedling stage, against those fungal isolates (H0019 and H0120), across three independent environments. On the basis of the mean performance across all three environments, a QTL against chlorosis located on the 6AS and linked to the RFLP locus Xksuh4c was significant for both isolates (with a LOD of 3.76 for isolate H0019 and 5.87 for H0120).

On the verification of architectural reconfigurations	COMPUTER LANGUAGES SYSTEMS & STRUCTURES			English	Article						Architectural reconfiguration; Architectural description language; Modal logic; Graded hybrid logic	SOFTWARE ARCHITECTURES; LOGICS	In a reconfigurable system, the response to contextual or internal change may trigger reconfiguration events which, on their turn, activate scripts that change the system's architecture at runtime. To be safe, however, such reconfigurations are expected to obey the fundamental principles originally specified by its architect. This paper introduces an approach to ensure that such principles are observed along reconfigurations by verifying them against concrete specifications in a suitable logic. Architectures, reconfiguration scripts, and principles are specified in ARCHERY, an architectural description language with formal semantics. Principles are encoded as constraints, which become formulas of a two-layer graded hybrid logic, where the upper layer restricts reconfigurations, and the lower layer constrains the resulting configurations. Constraints are verified by translating them into logic formulas, which are interpreted over models derived from ARCHERY specifications of architectures and reconfigurations. Suitable notions of bisimulation and refinement, to which the architect may resort to compare configurations, are given, and their relationship with modal validity is discussed.

A systemic approach to define and characterize Advanced Planning Systems (APS)	COMPUTERS & INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						ERP; APS; Advanced Planning System; Requirements; Architecture	SUPPLY CHAIN; SCHEDULING SYSTEMS; GENETIC ALGORITHM; OPTIMIZATION; CHALLENGES; DESIGN; MODEL	Advanced Planning Systems (APS) have become an important tool for manufacturing and production companies that require a specific system to optimize production, logistic, material and human resources, etc. with the goal of improving the economy of the companies and offer a good customer service. An APS must be integrated to the Enterprise's System (such as an ERP), but this task usually lacks of a specific methodology to be performed and is generally made ad-hoc. With the ultimate objective to provide an approach to facilitate this integration, this work presents a characterization of the APS from a systemic point of view, using standardized Software Engineering concepts. The idea is to provide a definition and characterization of Advanced Planning Systems, by establishing the main goals of this type of system, and considering Functional Requirements, Quality Attributes and a reference model for the architecture. The selected choices are established on the base of several international standards from the Software Engineering area, such as the SEBoK (System Engineering Body of Knowledge) and the SQuaRE (Software product Quality Requirements and Evaluation) model, among others, and aim to serve as a base line for the general concept of APS.

However, Argentina's increasing trends of environmental degradation and social conflict due to agriculture continue unabated. We qualitatively analyzed 24 published ES studies done in either the temperate Pampean (context of consolidated agriculture) or subtropical extra-Pampean regions (context of expanding agriculture), in order to identify country-level and context-specific research needs and gaps, and propose ways to address them. We observed that ES studies in both contexts: (i) tended to focus much more on the biophysical, supply-side of the ES cascade than on the assessment of cultural ES and benefits, (ii) invested more effort in describing coarse ecological patterns/processes than in producing locally-adapted knowledge through stakeholder participation, and (iii) were poorly articulated with decision-making processes regarding sustainable ecosystem management. Despite this, some ES studies performed in the context of expanding agriculture showed incipient efforts to recognize, disaggregate and involve stakeholders, and to understand ES values.

Social networks are useful tools to characterize these links but few studies include social and ecological nodes. We applied social network analysis to characterize governance and use networks in a coastal socio-ecological system while testing (i) if governance links reflects ecosystem services (ES) use links, (ii) if social links reflect ecological relations between continental and marine ES and (iii) if relations among social actors are associated with their use of and participation in the management of ES. We use structured interviews to build one-mode use and governance networks with social actors and two-mode networks relating social actors and ES. Our results showed cohesive, low density and centralized networks of governance and use. We found that actor-actor links reflect ecological relations between continental and marine environment, but actor-actor relations are weakly correlated with those derived from actor-ES relations, meaning that actors with common interest about ES are no necessarily working together. This paper also shows that social networks are useful to highlight gaps and paths to move the system toward more effective co-management structures. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This condition is useful in sunflower hybrid seed production. A MS form identified in an invasive population of H. annuus located in Las Malvinas was characterized by 37 morphological variables, six mitochondrial genes (atpA, atp6, coxIII, orfb, orfB and orfC) associated with cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS), five SSR loci associated with ms9, ms10, and ms11 nuclear male sterility genes, and the HRGO2 marker associated with the Rf1 fertility restoration gene for CMS-PET1. Restoration of MS condition was evaluated through crosses with 13 sunflower inbred lines. Las Malvinas site was described regarding its population size, spatial distribution, and male sterility occurrence. Ten years after the first observation, population size was over 250,000 individuals. The adoption of this species as ornamental plant in home gardens has contributed its expansion. The low frequency of MS plants found in natural conditions (0.4 %) is concordant with a CMS form in combination with restoration genes. Wild individuals harboring the CMS-PET1 cytoplasm and individuals carrying a different mitochondrial genome were found. The Rf1 restorer gene for CMS-PET1 was not detected. The new type of male sterility was different than CMS-PET1 in pollen morphology; absence of orfC; and different response to crosses with inbred lines. Molecular differences were found with CMS-RES1 and CMS-MAX1. The male sterility could not be explained by differences in the cytoplasmic or nuclear regions studied. The new MS form will expand the genetic diversity available for commercial hybrid sunflower production.

A single amino acid substitution in isozyme GST mu in Triclabendazole resistant Fasciola hepatica (Sligo strain) can substantially influence the manifestation of anthelmintic resistance	EXPERIMENTAL PARASITOLOGY			English	Article						Fasciola hepatica; Triclabendazole; Isozyme; Glutathione S-Transferases mu	GLUTATHIONE-S-TRANSFERASES; MOLECULAR CHARACTERIZATION; LIVER FLUKE; DRUG; BIOTRANSFORMATION; TRANSMISSION; METABOLISM; EXPRESSION; PATHWAYS; TUBULIN	The helminth parasite Fasciola hepatica causes fascioliasis in human and domestic ruminants. Economic losses due to this infection are estimated in (AS 2000-3000 million yearly. The most common method of control is the use of anthelmintic drugs. However, there is an increased concern about the growing appearance of F. hepatica resistance to Triclabendazole (TCBZ), an anthelmintic with activity over adult and young flukes. F. hepatica has eight Glutathione S-Transferase (GST) isozymes, which are enzymes involved in the detoxification of a wide range of substrates through chemical conjugation with glutathione. In the present work we identified and characterized the GST mu gene isolated from the TCBZ-susceptible and TCBZ-resistant F. hepatica strains. Total RNA was transcribed into cDNA by reverse transcription and a 657 bp amplicon corresponding to the GST mu gene was obtained. The comparative genetic analysis of the GST mu gene of the TCBZ susceptible strain (Cullompton) and TCBZ resistant strain (Sligo) showed three nucleotide changes and one amino acid change at position 143 in the GST mu isozyme of the TCBZ-resistant strain. These results have potential relevance as they contribute better understand the mechanisms that generate resistance to anthelmintics. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Succinate-cytochrome c reductase (complex activity (222 +/- 4 nmol/min. mg protein) was inhibited by 51% in the presence of 500 mu M GSNO and by 48% in the presence of 30 mu M SPER-NO, in both cases at 1.25 mu M NO. Neither GSNO nor SPER-NO were able to inhibit succinate-Q reductase activity (complex II; 220 +/- 9 nmol/min. mg protein), showing that NO affects complex III. Complex II-III activity was decreased (36%) when SMP were incubated with L-arginine and mtNOS cofactors, indicating that this effect is also produced by endogenous NO. GSNO (500 mu M) reduced cytochrome b(562) by 71%, in an [O-2] independent manner. Hyperbolic increases in 0(2)(center dot-) (up to 1.3 +/- 0.1 nmol/min. mg protein) and H2O2 (up to 0.64 +/- 0.05 nmol/min. mg protein) productions were observed with a maximal effect at 500 mu M GSNO. The 0(2)(center dot-)/H2O2 ratio was 1.98 in accordance with the stoichiometry of the 0(2)(center dot-) disproportionation. Moreover, H2O2 production was increased by 72-74% when heart coupled mitochondria were exposed to 500 mu M GSNO or 30 mu M SPER-NO. SMP incubated in the presence of succinate showed an EPR signal (g=1.99) compatible with a stable semiquinone. This EPR signal was increased not only by antimycin but also by GSNO and SPER-NO. These signals were not modified under N-2 atmosphere, indicating that they are not a consequence to the effect of NOx species on complex III area. These results show that NO interacts with ubiquinone-cytochrome b area producing antimycin-like effects. This behaviour comprises the inhibition of electron transfer, the interruption of the oxidation of cytochromes b, and the enhancement of [UQF(center dot)](ss) which, in turn, leads to an increase in 0(2)(center dot-) and H2O2 mitochondrial production rates.

Such conditions include, for example, lack of food and/or water, low or high temperatures, and reduced oxygen availability. In contrast to an expected strong suppression of protein synthesis, a great number of these animals present increased levels of antioxidant defenses during oxygen deprivation. These observations have puzzled researchers for more than 20 years. Initially, two predominant ideas seemed to be irreconcilable: on one hand, hypoxia would decrease reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, while on the other the induction of antioxidant enzymes would require the overproduction of ROS. This induction of antioxidant enzymes during hypoxia was viewed as a way to prepare animals for oxidative damage that may happen ultimately during reoxygenation. The term "preparation for oxidative stress" (POS) was coined in 1998 based on such premise. However, there are many cases of increased oxidative damage in several hypoxia-tolerant organisms under hypoxia. In addition, over the years, the idea of an assured decrease in ROS formation under hypoxia was challenged. Instead, several findings indicate that the production of ROS actually increases in response to hypoxia. Recently, it became possible to provide a comprehensive explanation for the induction of antioxidant enzymes under hypoxia. The supporting evidence and the limitations of the POS idea are extensively explored in this review as we discuss results from research on estivation and situations of low oxygen stress, such as hypoxia, freezing exposure, severe dehydration, and air exposure of water-breathing animals. We propose that, under some level of oxygen deprivation, ROS are overproduced and induce changes leading to hypoxic biochemical responses. These responses would occur mainly through the activation of specific transcription factors (FoxO, Nrf2, HIF-1, NF-kappa B, and p53) and post translational mechanisms, both mechanisms leading to enhanced antioxidant defenses. Moreover, reactive nitrogen species are candidate modulators of ROS generation in this scenario. We conclude by drawing out the future perspectives in this field of research, and how advances in the knowledge of the mechanisms involved in the PUS strategy will offer new and innovative study scenarios of biological and physiological cellular responses to environmental stress.

The main CD autoantigen, human tissue transglutaminase (TG2), is a challenge for the different expression systems available since its cross linking activity affects cellular processes. Plant based transient expression systems can be an alternative for the production of this protein. In this work, a transient expression system for the production of human TG2 in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves was optimized and reactivity of plant produced TG2 in CD screening test was evaluated. First, a subcellular targeting strategy was tested. Cytosolic, secretory, endoplasmic reticulum (C-terminal SEKDEL fusion) and vacuolar (C-terminal KISIA fusion) TG2 versions were transiently expressed in leaves and recombinant protein yields were measured. ER-TG2 and vac-TG2 levels were 9- to 16 fold higher than their cytosolic and secretory counterparts. As second strategy, TG2 variants were co-expressed with a hydrophobic elastin-like polymer (ELP) construct encoding for 36 repeats of the pentapeptide VPGXG in which the guest residue X were V and F in ratio 8:1. Protein bodies (PB) were induced by the ELP, with a consequent two in accumulation of both ER-TG2 and vac-TG2. Subsequently, ER-TG2 and vac-TG2 were produced and purified using immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography. Plant purified ER-TG2 and vac-TG2 were recognized by three anti-TG2 monoclonal antibodies that bind different epitopes proving that plant-produced antigen has immunochemical characteristics similar to those of human TG2. Lastly, an ELISA was performed with sera of CD patients and healthy controls. Both vac-TG2 and ER-TG2 were positively recognized by IgA of CD patients while they were not recognized by serum from non-celiac controls. These results confirmed the usefulness of plant-produced TG2 to develop screening assays. In conclusion, the combination of subcellular sorting strategy with co-expression with a PB inducing construct was sufficient to increase TG2 protein yields. This type of approach could be extended to other problematic proteins, highlighting the advantages of plant based production platforms.

Clinical outcomes in patients with isolated serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma (STIC): A comprehensive review	GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY			English	Review						Serous intraepithelial carcinoma; STIC; BRCA mutation; Risk reducing salpingo-oophorectomy	REDUCING SALPINGO-OOPHORECTOMY; OVARIAN-CANCER SYNDROME; MUTATION CARRIERS; PATHOLOGICAL FINDINGS; RISK REDUCTION; WOMEN; BRCA1; NEOPLASIA; SPECIMENS; CYTOLOGY	Objective. Serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma (STIC) is currently considered the precursor lesion of pelvic (i.e., ovarian or peritoneal) high-grade serous carcinoma. The incidence of STIC has been reported to range from 0.6% to 7% in BRCA mutations carriers. However, the clinical outcome of patients with 'isolated' STIC remains elusive. The aim of this study is to review the published literature on isolated STIC to determine outcomes of these patients and present a summary of management strategies. Methods. A systematic English-language literature search was conducted in PubMed, MEDLINE-Ovid, Scopus, EBSCOhost, Cochrane Library of articles published from February 2006 to April 2015. Study inclusion criteria for review were the following: risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO), BRCA mutation carriers, non-BRCA mutation carriers, and benign surgical indication. Exclusion criteria were as follows: the presence of synchronous gynecological cancers, concurrent non-gynecological malignancies, the presence of ovarian intraepithelial lesions, and articles that did not include any clinical information and were restricted to pathology information only. Results. A total of 78 patients with isolated STIC were included in our analysis. The median age for all patients was 53.7 years (range; 37-83). Surgical indication was RASO in 67 patients with BRCA mutations or high-risk personal or family history. In the other 11 patients, an incidental STIC was detected after surgery for non-cancerous indications. Eleven (16.4%) patients received chemotherapy after the diagnosis of STIC. The follow-up time ranged from 2 to 150 months. Three (4.5%) patients with BRCA mutations were diagnosed with primary peritoneal carcinoma (PPC) during the follow-up at 43,48 and 72 months after RASO. Conclusions. The rate of primary peritoneal carcinoma in patients with BRCA mutations and isolated STIC is 4.5%. The role of adjuvant therapy remains elusive and routine surveillance with tumor markers and imaging is not warranted. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

It's fed from a wire skirt, exhibits a resistive impedance and the inductive reactance can be nullified with a variable capacitor. Since the physical antenna behavior is not always clearly explained, to show the vertical radiation characteristics of the antenna height versus the antenna radius, as it is modified by the slanted wire, we present this paper. The high angle radiation is larger compared to the standard cylindrical series fed monopole of the same height, and for this reason in the U.S. the F.C.C. prohibited this system to be used at night. This paper determines the actual antenna characteristic according to the tower height and effective radius using the moment method software code. If one sets the antenna height to be used with similar radiation pattern as the traditional cylindrical series fed monopole this radiating system presents a very low area to ice accumulations and allows placing lightning beacon and other R.F. radiating systems with no technical problems.

A comparison of deterministic and stochastic approaches for regional scale inverse modeling on the Mar del Plata aquifer	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Real regional aquifer; Deterministic-stochastic approaches; Pilot points; Plausible calibration	UNSATURATED FRACTURED TUFF; 3-DIMENSIONAL NUMERICAL INVERSION; HETEROGENEOUS ALLUVIAL AQUIFER; STATE HYDRAULIC TOMOGRAPHY; GROUND-PENETRATING-RADAR; PILOT POINTS METHOD; CHAIN RANDOM-FIELDS; CROSS-HOLE TESTS; STEADY-STATE; GEOSTATISTICAL INVERSION	Inversion of the spatial variability of transmissivity (T) in groundwater models can be handled using either stochastic or deterministic (i.e., geology-based zonation) approaches. While stochastic methods predominate in scientific literature, they have never been formally compared to deterministic approaches, preferred by practitioners, for regional aquifer models. We use both approaches to model groundwater flow and solute transport in the Mar del Plata aquifer, where seawater intrusion is a major threat to freshwater resources. The relative performance of the two approaches is evaluated in terms of (i) model fits to head and concentration data (available for nearly a century), (ii) geological plausibility of the estimated T fields, and (iii) their ability to predict transport. We also address the impact of conditioning the estimated fields on T data coming from either pumping tests interpreted with the Theis method or specific capacity values from step-drawdown tests. We find that stochastic models, based upon conditional estimation and simulation techniques, identify some of the geological features (river deposit channels and low transmissivity regions associated to quartzite outcrops) and yield better fits to calibration data than the much simpler geology-based deterministic model, which cannot properly address model structure uncertainty. However, the latter demonstrates much greater robustness for predicting sea water intrusion and for incorporating concentrations as calibration data. We attribute the poor performance, and underestimated uncertainty, of the stochastic simulations to estimation bias introduced by model errors. Qualitative geological information is extremely rich in identifying large-scale variability patterns, which are identified by stochastic models only in data rich areas, and should be explicitly included in the calibration process.

A bivariate allometric study (via reduced major axis), including 21 variables from the skull and 6 from the lower jaw on samples varying from 21 to 32 specimens, was produced. Results of the analyses indicate fast growth in the rostrum and palatal length but isometric growth in nasal width, rostral height, and length of the upper diastema. Positive allometry is also present in mandibular length, in retromolar length of the lower jaw, and, especially, in height of the articular process. Negative allometry is found in the length and width of the tympanic bulla, braincase width, width of the occipital condyles, and occipital height. We document for the 1st time the presence of a 3rd premolar (dP3), represented by a tiny, rooted element, and which is lost in early postnatal ontogeny. Replacement of dP4/dp4 occurs after eruption of M3/m3. The complete eruption of P4/p4 happens when M3/m3 are fully functional. Ontogenetic changes in the postnatal ontogeny of the skull of D. branickii are mostly related to the development of the occlusal system and action of associated muscles. This is evidenced by rapid growth of the facial region, a deepening and strengthening of the temporal and occipital regions and a widening of the posterior portion of the palate which is related to the eruption and replacement of molariform teeth. Some observed that craniomandibular trends in the ontogeny of D. branickii are reflected in the size of Ctenohystrica taxa, with small species of this lineage showing features similar to those of juveniles of D. branickii and large species resembling adults of the pacarana.

Understanding the spatial variations in the diets of two Sturnira bats (Chiroptera: Phyllostomidae) in Argentina	JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY			English	Article						altitude; dietary simulations; Dirichlet regression; latitude; spatial segregation; Sturnira erythromos; S. lilium	FRUIT-EATING BATS; NORTHERN ARGENTINA; TROPHIC STRUCTURE; FRUGIVOROUS BATS; SELECTION; DIVERSIFICATION; DIVERSITY; PATTERNS; TRACKING; FORESTS	Frugivorous phyllostomid bats are a diverse group and one of the major partners of fleshy-fruited plants in seed dispersal mutualisms. The first step towards comprehension of mechanisms shaping the structure of highly diverse phyllostomids assemblages is to gather information about diet composition and to study the variations in the use of fruits across space. Herein we tested whether frugivorous phyllostomids changes the use of its fruits where fruit offer may change with the altitude and latitude. Particularity, using 1,525 dietary records from 20 sites, we evaluated the spatial use of Solanum, Piper and other fruits by two syntopic and similar species of Sturnira bats from Northwestern Argentina. The relationship between dietary compositions and spatial variables was studied through Dirichlet statistical regressions. Additionally, we constructed predictive models of diets in function of latitude and altitude by estimating the parameters of Dirichlet distributions, and compared then their behavior. Both bats showed spatial changes in the diets. However, in taking into account the overall pattern of predicted diets throughout the space, inter-specific differences were detected. While both species increased the use of Solanum with altitude, only Sturnira erythromos showed a meaningful altitudinal and latitudinal response concerning to the use of Piper and other fruits or Solanum, respectively. Our predictive models for diets enable us to split the space into two sectors, one characterized by a high dietary overlap and another with the salient feature of dissimilar preference towards the subsidiary resources. These findings call for a model of spatial segregation, acting at a regional scale, as a hypothetical mechanism allowing the coexistence of both species.

We developed and validated two SYBR green PCR (SYBR-PCR) and a real-time multiplex PCR (RT-PCR) to detect stx(1) and stx(2) genes in meat samples, and compared these techniques in ground beef samples from retail stores. One set of primers and one hydrolysis probe were designed for each six gene. For RT-PCR, an internal amplification control (IAC) was used. All PCR intra-laboratory validations were performed using pure strains and artificially contaminated ground beef samples. A total of 50 STEC and 30 non-STEC strains were used. Naturally contaminated ground beef samples (n = 103) were obtained from retail stores and screened with SYBR-PCR and RT-PCR, and stx-positive samples were processed for STEC isolation. In the intra-laboratory validation, each PCR obtained a 1 x 10(2) CFU mL(-1) limit of detection and 100% inclusivity and exclusivity. The same results were obtained when different laboratory analysts in alternate days performed the assay. The level of agreement obtained with SYBR-PCR and RT-PCR was kappa = 0.758 and 0.801 (P < 0.001) for stx(1) and stx(2) gene detection, respectively. Two PCR strategies were developed and validated, and excellent performance with artificially contaminated ground beef samples was obtained. However, the efforts made to isolate STEC from retail store samples were not enough. Only 11 STEC strains were isolated from 35 six-positive ground beef samples identically detected by all PCRs. The combination of molecular approaches based on the identification of a virulence genotypic profile of STEC must be considered to improve isolation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Molecular detection enables the accurate identification at the species level, providing additional information on the epidemiology and course of the clinical cases. Moreover, PCR and enzyme restriction analysis of the vector blood meal can be employed to study the tick feeding source and possibly identify pathogen's reservoir. Here, we review the molecular tools available for the identification and characterization of tick-borne bacteria from the genera Rickettsia, Ehrlichia and Anaplasma and for the study of ticks feeding behavior. We summarize the significant criteria for taxonomic identification of Rickettsiales species and propose a procedure algorithm for the classification of bacterial isolates as members of this order.

Bending waveguides made in x-cut lithium niobate crystals for technological applications	JOURNAL OF MICROMECHANICS AND MICROENGINEERING			English	Article						femtosecond laser writing; integrated optical deviators; curved guiding structures; propagation losses	FEMTOSECOND LASER-PULSES; FABRICATION; LINBO3; POLARIZATION; WRITTEN; DEVICES; GLASS	In this paper we analyse the performance of several designs of integrated optical deviators made in x-cut lithium niobate crystals by means of femtosecond laser writing using the double line approach. Straight and bent guiding structures have been designed and implemented using this technique. Well-confined propagation modes at communication wavelengths (1.55 mu m) were conducted in these structures with acceptable overall losses (less than 2 dB cm(-1)). Further, a discussion about the optical propagation losses for curved and straight deviators devices is included in this work. At a low aperture angle (less than 0.2 degrees), as expected, low losses were determined for both structures; however, a weak output light was observed for large angles (greater than 0.2 degrees) in the straight optical circuits. In contrast, a smooth variation of the output was measured for the bent structures. The results presented in this paper support the possibility of the technological implementation of integrated optical circuits for optical communications fabricated with ultrashort laser writing in lithium niobate crystals. In addition, some hypotheses of loss mechanisms that are normally not considered are discussed in order to explain the differences between the measured values and predictions obtained by calculating with the usual models.

Among them, Centropyxis constricta "constricta", Centropyxis elongata, Difflugia globulus, Diffiugia oblonga "oblonga", and Difflugia protaeiformis "amphoralis" are always present, while other taxa are randomly distributed. According to the sand/silt ratio in the different cores, the Total Organic Carbon content and the Carbon/Nitrogen ratio, as well as the presence/disappearance and abundance of testate amoebae from cluster analysis, we infer a correlation between major textural/granulometrical changes found in the cores and environmental changes. A seismic event occurred on 1949, which substantially modified the morphology of the eastern Lago Fagnano shoreline and the supply pattern from two main eastern tributaries of the lake, is recorded in the studied cores. This event has in part modified the distribution of testate amoebae taxa within the studied cores. Present results show that testate amoebae represent important indicators to detect changes occurring in the environment in which they live. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

They present significant lateral and vertical stratigraphic variations that determine diverse basin-patterns at different timing, scale and location. These issues cause difficulties to establish facies models, correlations and stratal stacking patterns of the fault-related stratigraphy, specially when exploration of hydrocarbon plays proceeds on the subsurface of a basin. The present case study corresponds to the rift-successions of the Neuquen Basin. This basin formed in response to continental extension that took place at the western margin of Gondwana during the Late Triassic-Early Jurassic. A tectono-stratigraphic analysis of the initial successions of the southern part of the Neuquen Basin was carried out. Three syn-rift sequences were determined. These syn-rift sequences were located in different extensional depocentres during the rifting phases. The specific periods of rifting show distinctly different structural and stratigraphic styles: from non-volcanic to volcanic successions and/or from continental to marine sedimentation. The results were compared with surface and subsurface interpretations performed for other depocentres of the basin, devising an integrated rifting scheme for the whole basin. The more accepted tectono-stratigraphic scheme that assumes the deposits of the first marine transgression (Cuyo Cycle) as indicative of the onset of a post-rift phase is reconsidered. In the southern part of the basin, the marine deposits (lower Cuyo Cycle) were integrated into the syn-rift phase, implying the existence of different tectonic signatures for Cuyo Cycle along the basin. The rift climax becomes younger from north to south along the basin. The post-rift initiation followed the diachronic ending of the main syn-rift phase throughout the Neuquen Basin. Thus, initiation of the post-rift stage started in the north and proceeded towards the south, constituting a diachronous post rift event. This arrangement implies that the lower part of Cuyo Cycle, traditionally related to regional thermal subsidence, may be deposited during either mechanical subsidence or thermal subsidence according to its position within the basin.

The pluton is a Lower Carboniferous monzogranite composed of K-feldspar, quartz, plagioclase and biotite. It exhibits an internal asymmetric textural zoning, defined by porphyritic granite in the southeastern region to equigranular granite in the northwestern region. The presence of subhorizontal dikes in the northwestern area, where the contacts dip shallowly, and subvertical dikes intruding the host rock nearby steep-dipping intrusive contacts in the southeastern region are compatible with an overall asymmetrical shape and internal structure of this pluton. Considering published crystallization ages, a dominant strain field occurring at around 12 Ma is inferred based on magmatic fabrics in the pluton and its host rock (the Huaco pluton), with a principal shortening direction oriented SW-NE, consistent with the general NW-SE strike of the body. Field evidence supports brittle fracturing and block displacement as the dominant emplacement mechanism, suggesting that magmatic stoping dominated during the late stage of the evolution of the magma chamber.

High-elevation mountains are the result of N-S reverse faults that disrupted a W-E Miocene Andean foreland basin. In the Sierra de Ambato (northern Argentine broken foreland) the reverse faults offset Neogene sedimentary rocks (Aconquija Fm., similar to 9 Ma) and affect the basement comprising Paleozoic metamorphic rocks that have been dated at similar to 477-470 Ma. In order to establish a chronology of these faults affecting the previous continuous basin we date the formation age of clay minerals associated with fault gouge using the K-Ar dating technique. Clay mineral formation is a fundamental process in the evolution of faults under the brittle regime (<<300 degrees C). K-Ar ages (9 fractions from 3 samples collected along a transect in the Sierra de Ambato) vary from Late Devonian to Late Triassic (similar to 360-220 Ma). This age distribution can be explained by a long lasting brittle deformation history with a minimum age of similar to 360 Ma and a last clay minerals forming event at similar to 220 Ma. Moreover, given the progression of apparent ages decreasing from coarse to fine size fractions (similar to 360-311 Ma for 2-1 mu m grain size fraction, similar to 326-286 Ma for 1-0.2 mu m and similar to 291-219 Ma of <0.2 mu m), we modeled discrete deformation events at similar to 417 Ma (ending of the Famatinian cycle), similar to 317-326 Ma (end of Gondwanic orogeny), and similar to 194-279 Ma (Early Permian - Jurassic deformation). According to our data, the Neogene reactivation would not have affected the K-Ar system neither generated a significant clay minerals crystallization in the fault gouge, although an exhumation of more than 2 Km is recorded in this period from stratigraphic data.

An in situ shelly fauna from the lower Paleozoic Zap la diamictite of northwestern Argentina: Implications for the age of glacial events across Gondwana	JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article						Brachiopods; Trilobites; Hirnantian/Silurian biostratigraphy; Glacial diamictites; Subandean ranges; South American basins; Gondwana	ORDOVICIAN-SILURIAN BOUNDARY; NORTH-WEST ARGENTINA; PARANA BASIN; LATEST ORDOVICIAN; BRACHIOPOD FAUNA; SOUTH-AFRICA; UPPERMOST ORDOVICIAN; OOLITIC IRONSTONES; SEDIMENTARY-ROCKS; EASTERN PARAGUAY	A shelly fauna from the upper part of the Zapla glacial diamictite includes the Ungulate brachiopod Orbiculoidea radiata Troedsson, the rhynchonelliforms Dalmanella cf. testudinaria (Dalman) and Paromalomena sp., the bivalve Modiolopsis? sp., and the trilobite Dalmanitina subandina Monaldi and Boso. Both taphonomic and paleoecologic data indicate a lack of transport reflecting the original community. The assemblage is closely comparable to the widespread latest Ordovician Hirnantia-Dalmanitina fauna. The Hirnantian age of the Zapla diamictite is further corroborated by the record of the northern Gondwana chitinozoans Spinachitina cf. oulebsiri Paris and Desmochitina minor typica Eisenack. The graptolites and chitinozoans from the overlying Lipeon Formation indicate that the postglacial transgression took place in the earliest Llandovery (Parakidograptus acuminatus Biozone). According to the tectonosedimentary evidence, the Early Silurian age of the Cancaniri and San Gaban diamictites of north central Bolivia and south Peru based on their palynological record is more likely the age of posglacial gravity flows and not that of the glaciation. We support the hypothesis that the weakly lithified glacigenic deposits of Hirnantian age were reworked and redistributed by high-energy marine processes during the postglacial transgression and then transported to the adjacent deep-marine trough. Iron-rich horizons have been recognized in many basins of southern South America reflecting eustatic and paleoclimatic fluctuations. Most of them formed during the early stages of the postglacial transgression at the Ordovician/Silurian transition and are associated with low sedimentation rates and condensed intervals. The mild maritime postglacial climate, the increasing atmospheric CO2, and possibly the presence of incipient vegetated areas led to extensive weathering of glacigenic sediments supplying iron into the marine system to form ferruginous deposits. The sea level fall related to the peak of glaciation is recorded by both paleovalley incision and a sharp subaerial to subglacial unconformity. The transgressive systems tract starts with fluvio-estuarine deposits within incised valleys followed by widespread deposition of subtidal to open marine organic-rich shales onlapping regionally the basement rocks. The recognition of key stratigraphic markers (e.g. sequence boundary, flooding surface, ferruginous beds), alongside reliable micro and macropaleontological evidence allow a more accurate correlation between the Central Andean Basin of Peru, Bolivia and NW Argentina, the W Puna region, the Paraguayan and Brazilian sectors of the Parana Basin, the Precordillera Basin of W Argentina, and the Cape Basin of South Africa.

The late Paleozoic palynological diversity in southernmost Parana (Uruguay), Claromeco and Paganzo basins (Argentina), Western Gondwana	JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article						Palynology; Diversity; Late paleozoic; Argentina; Uruguay	SOUTH-AMERICA; POLLEN; PALYNOSTRATIGRAPHY	This study explores the changes in palynoflora diversity of the late Paleozoic in boreholes DI.NA.MI.GE. 254 (26 samples) and DI.NA.MI.GE. 221 (14 samples) of the Parana Basin in Uruguay and in 18 surface samples of the La Deheza Formation (Paganzo Basin) and 10 samples of borehole UTAL.CMM1.La Estrella.x-1 (Claromeco Basin) in Argentina. Possible relationships among biostratigraphic zones, diversity levels, fades and climatic evolution patterns in Western Gondwana are studied. Diversity curves of boreholes 221 and 254 and the La Deheza Formation outcrop exhibit similar diversity evolution patterns, i.e., an increase in lower strata diversity and a decrease in upper strata diversity. The disappearance events are determined to be more prominent in biozones of the Cisuralian to the Guadalupian age and less prominent in biozones of the early Cisuralian age. The number of genera raises from the glaciomarine facies, through the deltaic and the marine facies, up to the shallow marine or lagoon facies, in which the disappearance rates become more prominent.. The diversity of the lower part of the La Estrella borehole is lesser than that of the other sequences These diversity, disappearance and appearance behaviors may reflect post-glacial climatic amelioration patterns and the beginning of an arid phase.

In particular, the vertical gravity gradient (Tzz), in comparison to the classic Bouguer anomaly, defines more accurately superficial mass heterogeneities. Moreover, the correction of these satellite-derived data from the effect of Earth topographic masses by means of new techniques taking into account the Earth curvature, improves results in regional analyses. In a recent work we found a correlation between Tzz and slip distribution for the 2010 Maule Mw = 8.8 earthquake. In the present work, we derive the vertical gravity gradient from the last GOCE only model, corrected by the topographic effect and also by the sediments on depocenters of the offshore region at the Peru Chile margin, in order to study a spatial relationship between different lobes of the gravity derived signal and the seismic sources of large megathrust earthquakes. In particular, we analyze this relation for the slip models of the 1996 Mw = 7.7 Nazca, 2001 Mw = 8.4 Arequipa, 2007 Mw = 8.0 Pisco events and for the slip models of the 2014 Mw = 8.2 Pisagua and Mw = 7.7 Iquique earthquakes from Schurr et al. (2014), including the previously analyzed 2010 Mw = 8.8 Maule event. Then we find a good correlation between vertical gravity gradients and main rupture zones, correlation that becomes even stronger as the event magnitude increases. Besides this, a gravity fall in the gravity gradient was noticed over the area of the main slip patches at least for the two years before 2014 Mw = 8.2 Pisagua and Mw = 7.7 Iquique earthquakes. Additionally, we found temporal variations of the gravity field after 2010 Mw = 8.8 Maule event, related to the main patches of the slip distribution, and coseismic deformation. Therefore, we analyzed vertical gravity gradient field variations as an indirect measure of the variable seismic coupling finding a potential relationship between Tzz and the seismic b-value. These relationships exemplify the strong potential of the satellite only derived models as a predictive tool to determine potential seismic energy released in a subduction segment, determining the potential size of a potential rupture zone, and in particular internal slip distribution that allows inferring coseismic displacement field at surface.

Thus, P and S seismic-wave velocities (Vp, Vs) as well as Poisson's ratio (a) among other parameters were derived for gabbros, leuco-gabbros and wehrlites, in greenschist and amphibolite metamorphic conditions using a framework of a wide variety of empirical observations from active continental margins. In addition, Vs lithosphere models along two west east cross sections were obtained using a joint inversion of teleseismic Rayleigh waves and receiver functions. These models clearly delineate the upper-plate crustal structure and the flat-slab subduction of the Nazca plate at about 100 km depth in this region. The suggested seismic velocity structure shows a relatively low (<3.3 km/s) Vs layer located in the first 15-18 km depth, then an increase of it from 3.3 to 4 km/s between 20 and 55 km depth with a mayor change at 40 km depth beneath the Precordillera showing an increase in Vs from 33 to 3.8 km/s. The Moho discontinuity was identified at around 65 km depth beneath the Precordillera (Vs = 4.3 km/s) and shows a low shear-wave velocity contrast in comparison with the upper continental mantle's parameters. Using this seismological model, Vs estimations derived from the petrological analyses for the 12 collected samples can be projected at depths greater than 30 km. These geophysical and petrological results agree with the hypothesis of a mafic thickened and partially eclogitized lower crust beneath the Precordillera, which has been predicted previously on a base of seismological studies only. Our petrological and seismological results collectively support a thick crustal model of a mafic-ultramafic composition extending to middle-to-lower crustal levels beneath Central and Western Precordillera; this region correlates with a suture zone between the eastern Cuyania terrane and the western Chilenia terrane.

Its location to the east of the mainly thin-skinned tectonics of the Argentine Precordillera fold-and-thrust belt suggests that at 30 degrees S, deformation is concentrated in a narrow zone involving these two morphostructural units. In this paper, we present new apatite (U-Th)/He results (AHe) across the northern part of the Sierra de Valle Fertil (around 30 degrees S) and analyze them in a framework of thermochronologic available datasets. We found Pliocene AHe results for Carboniferous and Triassic strata in the northern Sierra de Valle Fertil consistent with the hypothesis of recent cooling and inferred erosional denudation concentrated along the northern end of this mountain range. Our analysis shows that this northern region may have evolved under different conditions than the central part of the Sierra de Valle Fertil. Previous studies have observed AHe ages consistent with Permian through Cretaceous cooling, indicating the middle part of the Sierra de Valle Fertil remained near surface before the Pampean slab subduction flattening process. Those studies also obtained 5 My cooling ages in the southern part of the Sierra de Valle Fertil, which are similar to our results in the northern end of the range. Taken together, these results suggest a pattern of young deformation in the northern and southern low elevation ends of the Sierra de Valle Fertil consistent with regions of high seismic activity, and Quaternary active faulting along the western-bounding thrust fault of the Sierra de Valle Fertil.

The late stages of the Pampean Orogeny, Cordoba (Argentina): Evidence of postcollisional Early Cambrian slab break-off magmatism	JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article						Sierras Pampeanas; Western Gondwana; Rhyolites; Neoproterozoic; Cambrian; Orogenic collapse	EASTERN SIERRAS-PAMPEANAS; CALC-ALKALINE ARC; U-PB; PRECORDILLERA TERRANE; ISOTOPIC EVIDENCE; WESTERN GONDWANA; SM-ND; TH-PB; EVOLUTION; PROVENANCE	Widespread rhyolitic and mafic volcanism in the northern and southern sectors respectively of Eastern Sierras Pampeanas, central western Argentina, are associated with an important phase of extension and uplift linked to slab break-off on latest stages of the Pampean Orogeny. The main orogenic deformation took place between 540 and 535 Ma based on new ages available for this region. New U Pb ages in zircons from the Oman Rhyolite and new and old recalculated zircons from Los Burros Rhyodacite in the northern sector of Sierras de Cordoba, together with new U Pb ages of the southern sector, indicate that volcanic and subvolcanic rocks of both sectors are partially coeval and unconformably overlying and/or intruding the basement rocks during a period of exhumation and subsequent cooling at 530-520 Ma. These data are in agreement with previous estimates for the final uplift of the Sierras de Cordoba based on the K-Ar cooling ages. The southern sector of Eastern Sierras Pampeanas may represent deeper structural levels within the crust and is characterized by the occurrence of small mafic bodies with OIB-like signature. New and reinterpreted U-Pb SHRIMP and TIMS ages on zircons and monazites in the metamorphic associated rocks date this episode, which is related to a rapid slab break-off event at 519-515 Ma. This episode is also associated with the emplacement of peraluminous granitoids, and with the extension, cooling and final uplift of the rocks affected by the Pampean Orogeny all along the Eastern Sierras Pampeanas.

Late Cenozoic calc-alkaline volcanism over the Payenia shallow subduction zone, South-Central Andean back-arc (34 degrees 30 '-37 degrees S), Argentina	JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article						Andesitic volcanism; Shallow subduction; Back-arc; Geochemistry; San Rafael Block	PAMPEAN FLAT-SLAB; MENDOZA REGION; CURA-MALLIN; PROVINCE; BASIN; CHILE; EVOLUTION; PLIOCENE; MANTLE; GEOCHRONOLOGY	A series of mesosilicic volcanic centers have been studied on the San Rafael Block (SRB), 300 km to the east of the present-day volcanic arc. K-Ar ages indicate that this magmatic activity was developed in at least two stages: the older volcanic centers (similar to 15-10 Ma) are located in the central and westernmost part of the SRB (around 36 degrees S and 69 degrees W) and the younger centers (8-3.5 Ma) are located in an eastern position (around 36 degrees S and 69 degrees 30'W) with respect to the older group. These volcanic rocks have andesitic to dacitic compositions and correspond to a high-K calc-alkaline sequence as shown by their SiO2, K2O and FeO/MgO contents. Elevated Ba/La, Ba/Ta and La/Ta ratios show an arc-like signature, and primitive mantle normalized trace element diagrams show typical depletions of high field strength elements (HFSE) relative to large ion lithophile elements (LILE). Rare earth element (REE) patterns suggest pyroxene and amphibole crystallization. Geochemical data obtained for SRB volcanic rocks support the proposal for a shallow subduction zone for the latest Miocene between 34 degrees 30 ''-37 degrees S. Regionally, SRB volcanism is associated with a mid-Miocene to early Pliocene eastward arc migration caused by the shallowing of the subducting slab in the South-Central Andes at these latitudes, which represents the evolution of the Payenia shallow subduction segment. Overall, middle Miocene to early Pliocene volcanism located in the Payenia back-arc shows evidence for the influence of slab-related components. The younger (8-3.5 Ma) San Rafael volcanic rocks indicate the maximum slab shallowing and the easternmost extent of slab influence in the back-arc. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Exhumation of the Neuquen Basin in the southern Central Andes (Malargile fold and thrust belt) from field data and low-temperature thermochronology	JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article						Neuquen Basin; Southern Central Andes; Exhumation; AFTA apatite fission track analysis; Magmatic activity	CENTRAL CHILE; TECTONIC EVOLUTION; FLAT-SLAB; SUBDUCTION ZONES; PATAGONIAN ANDES; CONVERGENCE RATE; CURA-MALLIN; MAGMATISM; FORELAND; ARGENTINA	Apatite fission-track analysis performed on eighteen Mesozoic sediment samples of the Neuquen Basin from the Southern Central Andes orogenic front between 35 degrees 30' and 37 degrees S has revealed Campanian-Paleocene (75-55 Ma), late Eocene-early Oligocene (35-30 Ma) and middle Miocene (15-10 Ma) cooling episodes. Each cooling episode corresponds closely with major unconformities observed in the preserved sedimentary sequences, and is associated with kilometer-scale additional burial and subsequent exhumation. A similar degree of cooling is inferred from associated vitrinite reflectance data. Late Eocene-early Oligocene exhumation is recognized only near the eastern orogenic front adjacent to the foreland in the southernmost part of the study area and may be related partly to within-plate magmatism and associated extension in the Palaoco Basin. The Campanian-Paleocene and middle Miocene cooling episodes are recognized more widely in the fold and thrust belt and appear to coincide with periods of eastward arc expansion and mountain building processes.

Four structural cross-sections in the entire deformed area, supported by field and subsurface data, suggest a strong link between thick and thin-skinned structures. Major Andean thrusts branching from a detachment placed 12 km into the crust created large basement wedges, which were inserted in the cover producing minor order structures. The westernmost of these wedges is exposed forming the Cordillera del Viento, while others basement slices at depth were interpreted from seismic lines. These thick-skinned structures transferred deformation to the cover along the Auquilco Formation and contributed to create all thin-skinned structures surveyed in the Chos Malal FTB. We recognized half-graben geometries in the seismic lines, preserving their extensional configuration, which suggests that the main normal faults were not inverted. Shortenings calculated from the restoration of the four cross-sections are 16.9 km (29.7%), 16.9 km (29.7%), 14.7 km (26.9%) and 14.15 km (26.3%), which evidence a slight diminution of the contraction toward the south probably associated with the plunge of the Cordillera del Viento structure in this segment of the Chos Malal FTB.

Evolution of the Chos Malal and Agrio fold and thrust belts, Andes of Neuquen: Insights from structural analysis and apatite fission track dating	JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article						Andean uplift; Exhumation; Foreland basin; Synorogenic deposits; Thin-skinned belt; Thick-skinned belt; Tectonic inversion	SOUTHERN CENTRAL ANDES; TECTONIC EVOLUTION; NAZCA FARALLON; CENTRAL CHILE; BASIN; ARGENTINA; THERMOCHRONOLOGY; REACTIVATION; CONVERGENCE; INVERSION	The Chos Malal and Agrio fold and thrust belts are located in the western part of the Neuquen basin, an Andean retroarc basin of central-western Argentina. Both belts show evidence of tectonic inversion at the western part during Late Cretaceous times. The eastern part is dominated by late Miocene deformation which also partially reactivated the western structures. This work focuses on the study of the regional structure and the deformational event that shaped the relief of this part of the Andes. Based on new field work and structural data and previously published works a detailed map of the central part of the Neuquen basin is presented. Three regional structural cross sections were surveyed and balanced using the 2d Move(TM) software. In order to define a more accurate uplift history, new apatite fission track analyses were carried on selected structures. These data was used for new thermal history modeling of the inner part of the Agrio and Chos Malal fold and thrust belts. The results of the fission track analyses improve the knowledge of how these fold and thrust belts have grown trough time. Two main deformational events are defined in Late Cretaceous to Paleocene and Late Miocene times. Based on this regional structural analysis and the fission track data the precise location of the orogenic front for the Late Cretaceous-Paleocene times is reconstructed and it is proposed a structural evolution of this segment of the Andes. This new exhumation data show how the Late Cretaceous to Paleocene event was a continuous and uninterrupted deformational event. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Rojas Vera, E.

Detrital and volcanic zircon U-Pb ages from southern Mendoza (Argentina): An insight on the source regions in the northern part of the Neuquen Basin	JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article						Southern Central Andes; Jurassic; Provenance; Andean basin	SOUTHWESTERN GONDWANA; CONTINENTAL-CRUST; FORELAND DEFORMATION; TECTONIC EVOLUTION; SAN RAFAEL; HF-ISOTOPE; CUYO BASIN; HIGH ANDES; CONSTRAINTS; PROVENANCE	The infill of the Neuquen Basin recorded the Meso-Cenozoic geological and tectonic evolution of the southern Central Andes being an excellent site to investigate how the pattern of detrital zircon ages varies trough time. In this work we analyze the U-Pb (LA-MC-ICP-MS) zircon ages from sedimentary and volcanic rocks related to synrift and retroarc stages of the northern part of the Neuquen Basin. These data define the crystallization age of the synrift volcanism at 223 +/- 2 Ma (Cerro Negro Andesite) and the maximum depositional age of the original synrift sediments at ca. 204 Ma (El Freno Formation). Two different pulses of rifting could be recognized according to the absolute ages, the oldest developed during the Norian and the younger during the Rhaetian Sinemurian. The source regions of the El Freno Formation show that the Choiyoi magmatic province was the main source rock of sediment supply. An important amount of detrital zircons with Triassic ages was identified and interpreted as a source area related to the synrift magmatism. The maximum depositional age calculated for the Tordillo Formation in the Atuel-La Valenciana depocenter is at ca. 149 Ma; as well as in other places of the Neuquen Basin, the U-Pb ages calculated in the Late Jurassic Tordillo Formation do not agree with the absolute age of the Kimmeridgian Tithonian boundary (ca. 152 Ma). The main source region of sediment in the Tordillo Formation was the Andean magmatic arc. Basement regions were also present with age peaks at the Carboniferous, Neoproterozoic, and Mesoproterozoic; these regions were probably located to the east in the San Rafael Block. The pattern of zircon ages summarized for the Late Jurassic Tordillo and Lagunillas formations were interpreted as a record of the magmatic activity during the Triassic and Jurassic in the southern Central Andes. A waning of the magmatism is inferred to have happened during the Triassic. The evident lack of ages observed around ca. 200 Ma suggests cessation of the synrift magmatism. The later increase in magmatic activity during the Early Jurassic is attributed to the onset of Andean subduction, with maximum peaks at ca. 191 and 179 Ma. The trough at ca. 165 Ma and the later increase in the late Jurassic could be explained by changes in the relative convergence rate in the Andean subduction regime, or by the shift to a more mafic composition of the magmatism with minor zircon fertility.

Evolution of the Neogene Andean foreland basins of the Southern Pampas and Northern Patagonia (34 degrees-41 degrees S), Argentina	JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article						Basin analysis; Neogene; Dynamic topography; Broken Andean foreland; Southern Pampa	LATE MIOCENE; THRUST BELT; FLAT-SLAB; SUBDUCTION; SUBSIDENCE; BOLIVIA; SYSTEMS; TIME	The Pampas plain (30 degrees-41 degrees S) has historically been considered as a sector that evolved independently from the adjacent Andean ranges. Nevertheless, the study of the Pampas showed that it is reasonable to expect an important influence from the Andes into the extraandean area. The Pampas plain can be divided into two sectors: the northern portion, adjacent to the Pampean Ranges, has been studied by Davila (2005, 2007, 2010). The southern sector (34 degrees-41 degrees S) is the objective of the present work. The study of this area allowed to characterize two separate foreland basins: the Southern Pampa basin and the Northern Patagonian basin. The infill is composed of Late Miocene and Pliocene units, interpreted as distal synorogenic sequences associated with the late Cenozoic Andean uplift at this latitudinal range. These foreland basins have been defined based on fades changes, distinct depositional styles, along with the analysis of sedimentary and isopach maps. The basins geometries are proposed following De Celles and Gilles (1996) taking into account the infill geometry, distribution and grain size. In both cases, these depocenters are located remarkably far away from the Andean tectonics loads. Therefore they cannot be explained with short-wave subsidence patterns. Elastic models explain the tectonic subsidence in the proximal depocenters but fail to replicate the complete distal basins. These characteristics show that dynamic subsidence is controlling the subsidence in the Southern Pampas and Northern Patagonian basins. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The North Patagonian orogenic front and related foreland evolution during the Miocene, analyzed from synorogenic sedimentation and U/Pb dating (similar to 42 degrees S)	JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article						Andean uplift; Foreland basin; Nirihuau Basin; Growth strata	SOUTHERN CENTRAL ANDES; TECTONIC EVOLUTION; CONVERGENCE RATE; BASIN FORMATION; NIRIHUAU BASIN; CENTRAL CHILE; ARGENTINA; GEOCHRONOLOGY; DEFORMATION; NEUQUEN	Miocene sedimentary successions of the Nirihuau and Collon Cura formations east of the El Maiten Belt constitute a partial record of the Andean exhumation, defining a synorogenic infill of the Nirihuau Basin in the foothills of the North Patagonian fold and thrust belt. Gravimetric and seismic data allow recognizing the internal arrangement and geometry of these depocenters that host both units, separating a synextensional section previous to the Andean development at these latitudes, from a series of syncontractional units above. A series of progressive unconformities in the upper terms shows the synorogenic character of these units corresponding to the different pulses of deformation that occurred during the middle Miocene. New U-Pb ages constrain these pulses to the similar to 13.5-12.9 Ma interval and allow reconstructing the tectonic history of this region based on the detrital zircon source populations. The U-Pb maximum ages of sedimentation give to the Nirihuau Formation in particular a younger age than previously assumed. Additionally, synsedimentary deformation in strata of the upper exposures of the Collon Cura Formation associated with contractional structures and U-Pb ages allow identifying a younger paleoseismogenic pulse in 11.3 Ma. Thus, based on these data and a compilation of previous datasets, a tectonic evolution is proposed characterized by a contractional episode that migrated eastwardly since similar to 19 to 15 Ma producing the Gastre broken foreland and then retracted to the eastern North Patagonian Precordillera, where out-of-sequence thrusts cannibalized the wedge top zone in the El Maiten belt at similar to 13.5-11.3 Ma.

Tectonic inversion events in the western San Jorge Gulf Basin from seismic, borehole and field data	JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article						Rift basin; Tectonic inversion; Central Patagonia; Cretaceous deformation	BAJO BARREAL FORMATION; PATAGONIAN FORELAND; CHUBUT GROUP; ARGENTINA; EVOLUTION; SAUROPODA; CORDILLERA; DINOSAURIA; PROVINCE; UPLIFT	The San Jorge Gulf Basin, located in Central Patagonia, has been interpreted as a Jurassic-Cretaceous rift basin that was later inverted mainly in its western sector. Consequently, the Bemardides System formed as a set of foreland contractional structures that constitute the core of the Patagonian broken foreland, exhuming continental deposits of the Cretaceous Chubut Group, 500 km away from the Pacific trench. In spite of the intense research done in the San Jorge Gulf Basin many aspects remain under discussion, particularly those regarding the age of uplift of the Bernardides System. In order to unravel the tectonic evolution of the western San Jorge Gulf Basin (Rio Mayo Sub-Basin), we analyzed subsurface information (2D and 3D seismic lines and oil wells) located in the western area of the basin and compared this with surface data of the southern Bernardides System. Based on our interpretation, the western part of the basin could have been uplifted in a series of deformational events that began as early as late Early Cretaceous, related to the initial uplift of the Patagonian broken foreland, during the early stages of South Atlantic opening. Subsequent stages of tectonic reactivation identified in this system have selectively inverted previous extensional structures according to the variable direction of the greatest horizontal stress (sigma 1) acting at each time.

Lower Cretaceous provenance in the northern Austral basin of Patagonia from sedimentary petrography	JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article						Austral basin; Southern Patagonian Andes; Early Cretaceous; Sandstone provenance; Sedimentary petrography	MAGALLANES FORELAND BASIN; BREAK-UP; SOUTHERN PATAGONIA; KACHAIKE FORMATION; ANDES OROGENY; THRUST BELT; SANTA-CRUZ; ARGENTINA; GONDWANA; EVOLUTION	The northern Austral basin from Patagonia is characterized by an Early Cretaceous (Barremian Albian) coarse-grained regressive sequence. These littoral to continental deposits conform a 150 km long basin cropping out along the Southern Patagonian Andes between 47 and 48 degrees S. The basin fill consist of basal deltaic sandstones with interbedded shales and limestones from the Rio Belgrano Formation, topped by up to 350 m of fluvial conglomerates and reworked tuffs of the Rio Tarde and Kachaike formations. This continental depocenter represent a major geodynamic and paleoenviromental change from the underling marine Rio Mayer Formation. In this study we analyze the tectonic setting and provenance during deposition of the coarse-grained sequence using sedimentary petrography of 37 thin sections in four stratigraphic profiles covering the northern basin.

A review about the mechanisms associated with active deformation, regional uplift and subsidence in southern South America	JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article						Uplift; Deformation; Quaternary; Neotectonics; Andes; Pacific and Atlantic coasts	PAYENIA VOLCANIC PROVINCE; CENTRAL ANDEAN PLATEAU; NORTH-CENTRAL CHILE; SUBDUCTION EROSION; THRUST BELT; MARINE TERRACES; LONCOPUE TROUGH; NEUQUEN ANDES; NAZCA PLATE; FORE-ARC	A broad range of processes acted simultaneously during the Quaternary producing relief in the Andes and adjacent foreland, from the Chilean coast, where the Pacific Ocean floor is being subducted beneath South American, to the Brazilian and the Argentinean Atlantic platform area. This picture shows to be complex and responds to a variety of processes. The Geoid exemplifies this spectrum of uplift mechanisms, since it reflects an important change at 35 degrees S along the Andes and the foreland that could be indicating the presence of dynamic forces modeling the topography with varying intensity through the subduction margin. On the other hand, mountains uplifted in the Atlantic margin, along a vast sector of the Brazilian Atlantic coast and inland regions seem to be created at the area where the passive margin has been hyper-extended and consequently mechanically debilitated and the forearc region shifts eastwardly at a similar rate than the westward advancing continent. Therefore the forearc at the Arica latitudes can be considered as relatively stationary and dynamically sustained by a perpendicular-to-the-margin asthenospheric flow that inhibits trench roll back, determining a highly active orogenic setting at the eastern Andes in the Subandean region. To the south, the Pampean flat subduction zone creates particular conditions for deformation and rapid propagation of the orogenic front producing a high-amplitude orogen. In the southern Central and Patagonian Andes, mountain (orogenic) building processes are attenuated, becoming dominant other mechanisms of exhumation such as the i) impact of mantle plumes originated in the 660 km mantle transition, ii) the ice-masse retreat from the Andes after the Pleistocene producing an isostatic rebound, iii) the dynamic topography associated with the opening of an asthenospheric window during the subduction of the Chile ridge and slab tearing processes, iv) the subduction of oceanic swells linked to transform zones and v) the accretion of oceanic materials beneath the forearc region. Additionally and after last geodetic studies, vi) exhumation due to co- and post-seismic lithospheric stretching associated with large earthquakes along the subduction zone, also shows to be a factor associated with regional uplift that needs to be further considered as an additional mechanism from the Chilean coast to the western retroarc area. Finally, this revision constitutes a general picture about the different mechanisms of uplift and active deformation along the Southern Andes, in which orogenic processes become dominant north of 35 degrees S, while south of these latitudes dynamic forces seem to predominate all over the Patagonian platform.

Synthesis of Grafted Block Copolymers Based on epsilon-Caprolactone: Influence of Branches on Their Thermal Behavior	MACROMOLECULAR CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article						branched copolymers; poly(2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate) (PHEMA); poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL); RAFT and ROP polymerization; thermal behavior	FRAGMENTATION CHAIN TRANSFER; COMB COPOLYMERS; HYPERBRANCHED POLY(EPSILON-CAPROLACTONE)S; POLY(2-HYDROXYETHYL METHACRYLATE); NONISOTHERMAL CRYSTALLIZATION; POLY(VINYL METHYL-ETHER); MICROPHASE SEPARATION; POLYMERIZATION; KINETICS; HYDROGELS	Branched copolymers are a special class of polymeric materials in which are reflected the combined effects of polymer segments and architectural constraints of the branched architecture. This study employed two methodologies to obtain copolymers with different branching density. In the first case, poly(hydroxyethyl methacrylate-graft-poly(e-caprolactone)-block-poly(epsilon-caprolactone), P(HEMA-g-PCL)-b-PCL, copolymers were synthesized by a "grafting through" method in a three-step reaction pathway involving ring opening polymerization (ROP) and radical addition fragmentation transfer (RAFT) polymerization. In the second case, a combination of simultaneous "grafting through" and "grafting from" methods in a one-pot RAFT and ROP reaction afforded P(HEMA-co-HEMA-g-PCL)-b-PCL comb-like copolymers with comparatively less dense branching. Samples with molar masses between 5500 and 46 000 g mol(-1) and polydispersity indexes (M-w/M-n) lower than 1.3 were successfully obtained through both approaches. According to thermal analyses, the presence of branches reduces PCL melting temperature by as much as 20 degrees C, without affecting thermal stability. This fact was particularly evident for the most densely branched copolymers with higher molar masses. Nonisothermal crystallization process was successfully described using Ozawa's method, which showed a clear dependence of crystallization rate and cooling on grafting density.

STUDY FINDING:Targeting trophoblast cells with VIP induces monocyte migration, polarization to anti-inflammatory phenotypes and apoptotic trophoblast cell clearance which involves increased alpha v beta 3 integrin expression on phagocytic cells and binding to thrombospondin 1. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY:Monocytes recruited to the maternal-placental interface interact with trophoblast cells and differentiate to alternatively activated macrophages involved in the silent clearance of apoptotic cells. Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is an immunomodulatory polypeptide synthesized at the human placenta that can target both trophoblast cells and monocytes/macrophages. Integrin alpha v beta 3 and thrombospondin 1 are involved in the formation of a phagocytic portal for the immunosuppressant clearance of apoptotic cells. STUDY DESIGN, SAMPLES/MATERIALS, METHODS:This is a laboratory-based study studying monocytes isolated from peripheral blood of healthy women (n = 33) and their interaction in vitro with first trimester trophoblast cell lines. Peripheral blood monocytes were isolated from healthy volunteers by Percoll gradient and tested in co-culture settings with first trimester trophoblast cell lines (Swan 71 and HTR8) or with trophoblast cell conditioned media obtained in the presence or absence of 10 or 100 nM VIP. The effect of VIP-conditioned media on monocyte migration was assessed through transwell systems and monocyte/macrophage phenotype was determined by flow cytometry. Phagocytosis of apoptotic cells and the mechanisms involved in phagocytic portal formation were assessed by flow cytometry, confocal microscopy, immunological blockade and RT-PCR. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE:Exposing cells to 100 nM VIP increased the migration of monocytes toward trophoblast cell conditioned media (VIP conditioned medium) (P < 0.05 versus conditioned media from cells not exposed to VIP) and contributed to the monocytes acquiring an anti-inflammatory profile with increased CD39 and IL-10 expression (P < 0.05). Phagocytosis of apoptotic trophoblast cells by monocytes and monocyte-differentiated macrophages was increased by VIP conditioned medium (P < 0.05 versus media conditioned in the absence of VIP or direct addition of 100 nM VIP). The boosting effect of VIP conditioned medium on phagocytosis involved increased expression and re-localization of alpha v beta 3 integrin on phagocytic cells along with enhanced expression of thrombospondin 1 on trophoblast cells. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION:The conclusions are based on in vitro experiments with monocytes drawn from peripheral blood of healthy individuals and trophoblast cell lines and we were unable to ascertain that these mechanisms operate similarly in vivo. We cannot rule out a differential behavior of either trophoblast cells targeted in vivo with VIP, or primary cultures of first trimester trophoblast cells assayed in vitro. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS:The results presented provide new clues for immune and trophoblast cell pharmacological targeting in pregnancy complications of immunopathologic nature.

Stochastic perturbations of convex billiards	NONLINEARITY			English	Article						billiard systems; random perturbations; uniform ergodicity; invariant measure	TABLES	We consider a strictly convex billiard table with C-2 boundary, with the dynamics subjected to random perturbations. Each time the billiard ball hits the boundary its reflection angle has a random perturbation. The perturbation distribution corresponds to a situation where either the scale of the surface irregularities is smaller than but comparable to the diameter of the reflected object, or the billiard ball is not perfectly rigid. We prove that for a large class of such perturbations the resulting Markov chain is uniformly ergodic, although this is not true in general.

The entrance of Ca occurs via paracellular and intracellular pathways. All steps of the latter pathway are regulated by calcitriol and by other hormones. Dietary and pharmacological compounds also modulate the intestinal Ca absorption process. Among them, dietary Ca and P are known to alter the lipid and protein composition of the brush-border and basolateral membranes and, consequently, Ca transport. Ca intakes are below the requirements recommended by health professionals in most countries, triggering important health problems. Chronic low Ca intake has been related to illness conditions such as osteoporosis, hypertension, renal lithiasis and incidences of human cancer. Carbohydrates, mainly lactose, and prebiotics have been described as positive modulators of intestinal Ca absorption. Apparently, high meat proteins increase intestinal Ca absorption while the effect of dietary lipids remains unclear. Pharmacological compounds such as menadione, dl-butionine-S,R-sulfoximine and ursodeoxycholic acid also modify intestinal Ca absorption as a consequence of altering the redox state of the epithelial cells. The paracellular pathway of intestinal Ca absorption is poorly known and is under present study in some laboratories. Another field that needs to be explored more intensively is the influence of the gene x diet interaction on intestinal Ca absorption. Health professionals should be aware of this knowledge in order to develop nutritional or medical strategies to stimulate the efficiency of intestinal Ca absorption and to prevent diseases.

For a criterion validity study, a second sample of 394 students at the University of Buenos Aires was selected (47% men; M age = 24 yr., SD = 3.7; 53% women; M age = 23.6 yr., SD = 3.4). Cronbach's as ranged from .60 to .86, indicating adequate internal consistency. Following American, German, and Spanish studies, a first analysis on the 22 scales obtained a five-factor solution (65.3% of total variance), and a second analysis on 11 clinical scales isolated a two-factor solution (69.3% of total variance). Correlations with the Symptom Checklist-90-R provided support for criterion validity. Most of the scales and subscales showed sex differences and differences between American and Argentinean samples.

Histidine-rich glycoprotein and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis	RESPIRATORY MEDICINE			English	Article						Histidine-rich glycoprotein; Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis; BAL; Forced vital capacity	MACROPHAGES; PLASMA	Histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRG) is an enigmatic glycoprotein able to interact with a variety of ligands such as IgG, complement components, heparan sulfate, thrombospondin, fibrinogen and plasminogen. HRG is present at high concentrations in plasma and there is evidence indicating that it is able to modulate the course of biological processes such as angiogenesis, fibroblast proliferation, complement activation, coagulation and fibrinolysis. Because these processes are involved in the pathogeneses of lung fibrosis we here analyzed a possible link between HRG and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). We found that plasma concentrations of HRG are significantly diminished in IPF patients compared to healthy subjects. Moreover, we found a positive correlation between HRG plasma levels and forced vital capacity (FVC) values, suggesting that plasma concentration of HRG would be a useful indicator of disease activity in IPF. HRG has been described as a negative acute phase reactant able to accumulate at sites of tissue injury. Hence, we also measured the concentrations of HRG in BAL samples from IPF patients. We found that the concentrations of HRG in samples from IPF patients were significantly higher compared to controls, suggesting that the reduced concentration of HRG in plasma from IPF patients could be due, at least in part, to an enhanced uptake of this protein in the lung.

To date, no studies have specifically assessed the course of persistent symptoms or the individual contributions of positive and negative symptoms to patient functioning. The cross-sectional analysis of the Pattern study provides an international perspective of the burden of schizophrenia. Methods: Clinically stable outpatients from 140 study centers across eight countries (Argentina, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom) were assessed using clinical rating scales: Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Clinical Global Impression-Schizophrenia (CGI-SCH) Scale and the Personal and Social Performance (PSP) Scale. Additional measures included patient-reported outcomes, patient sociodemographic variables, living situation, employment and resource use. Results: Overall, 1379 patients were assessed and analyzed and had similar sociodemographic characteristics across countries, with 61.6% having persistent positive and/or negative symptoms. Positive and negative symptoms had been persistent for a mean of 9.6 and 8.9 years (SD: 8.8 and 9.6), respectively. Approximately 86% of patients had a functional disability classified as greater than mild. Patients with a higher PANSS Negative Symptom Factor Score were more likely to have a poorer level of functioning. Conclusions: This analysis examines individual contributions of persistent positive and negative symptoms on patient functioning in different countries. A high prevalence of patients with persistent symptoms and functional impairment was a consistent finding across countries. Longitudinal observations are necessary to assess how to improve persistent symptoms of schizophrenia and overall patient functioning. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Conversion-related factors and learning curve impacts, were poorly described. The aim of this study was to review the reasons and related factor for conversion in VATS lobectomy and the impact on this of the surgeon's learning curve. From June 2009 to May 2014, 154 patients who underwent a VATS lobectomy were included in our study. Patients' characteristics, pathology background, operative times, overall length of stay, overall morbidity and type of major complications were recorded for all patients and compared between non converted (n = 133) and converted (n = 21) patients. To evaluate surgeon's learning curve, we analyzed rates and causes of conversion in the first period (first 77 patients) and in the last period (78-154 patients). Patients characteristics were similar between converted and non-converted groups. Patients who were converted to open thoracotomy presented more frecuently tumors > 3 cms (P = 0.02). The average of operative times and the length of stay were not significantly different between groups. Overall morbidity and major complications were also similar in both groups. There were no impact of surgeon's learning curve in overall rate conversion in both groups. Emergency conversion was always secondary to vascular accidents, all in the first group (p = 0.059). Surgeons should be expecting to perform a conversion to a thoracotomy in patients who present in preoperative studies, tumors greater than 3 cms. Learning curve only affected the emergency conversion, occurred all in the first half of our series.

There is a group-subgroup relationship linking (I)-(II), due to cell doubling and the disappearance of a number of symmetry operations. In addition to X-ray diffraction, the transition has been monitored by Raman spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry, the latter disclosing an enthalpy change of 0.72 (6) kJ mol(-1). Variations of the unit-cell parameters with temperature between 170 and 293 K are presented. The evolution of diffraction spots in the vicinity of the transition temperature shows the coexistence of both phases, confirming the first-order character of the transition. Structural details of both phases are analyzed and intermolecular interactions compared in order to investigate the mechanism of the phase transition. A three-dimensional Hirshfeld surface analysis was performed to corroborate the significant changes in the intermolecular features.

Possible reasons for this outcome, which is exceptional in an otherwise firmly established synthetic procedure, are analyzed. Compound (I) is unsolvated, while compound (II) crystallizes with a tetrahydrofuran solvent molecule lying on an inversion centre. The ethoxycarbonyl chain of (II), in turn, appears disordered into two equally populated (50%) moieties. In both structures, a plethora of different commonly occurring weak intermolecular interactions [viz. pi(phenyl)center dot center dot center dot pi(phenyl), pi(C=N)center dot center dot center dot pi(C=N), pi(phenyl)center dot center dot center dot pi(C=N), N-H center dot center dot center dot O and C-H center dot center dot center dot O] appear responsible for the crystal stability. Much less common are the short O(nitro)center dot center dot center dot O(nitro) contacts which are observed in the structure of (I), an example of unusual 'electron donor-acceptor' (EDA) interactions.

A continuous start-up cost is generated in a period whenever there is a nonzero production in the period and the production capacity in the previous period is not saturated. This concept of start-up does not correspond to the standard (discrete) start-up considered in previous models, thus motivating a polyhedral study of this problem. In this work we explore a natural integer programming formulation for this problem. We consider the polytope obtained as convex hull of the feasible points in this problem. We state some general properties, study whether the model constraints define facets, and present an exponentially-sized family of valid inequalities for it. We analyze the structure of the extreme points of this convex hull, their adjacency and bounds for the polytope diameter. Finally, we study the particular case when the demands are high enough in order to require production in all the periods. We provide a complete description of the convex hull of feasible solutions in this case and show that all the inequalities in this description are separable in polynomial time, thus proving its polynomial time solvability.

This paper is focused on a series of commercial EPCs (Versify by Dow) with well-characterized ethylene content. Particular emphasis is given on the analysis of crystal type and content and their. relation with EPC chain microstructure. Information provided by Raman is compared with that obtained by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), a well-established technique widely used in the polymer field. Temperature-resolved Raman experiments are also carried out to interpret more precisely the complex melting patterns observed in the DSC traces. These experiments reveal with more detail the crystal chemical composition and melting temperature ranges of EPC samples, key features to design processing conditions that guarantee optimum lifetime and recyclability of overmolded parts.

In this study, an internal body trigger (heart evoked potential, HEP) was used to measure ongoing internally triggered signals during emotional states. We employed high-density electroencephalography (hd-EEG), source reconstruction analysis, and behavioral measures to assess healthy participants watching emotion-inducing video-clips (positive, negative, and neutral emotions). Results showed emotional modulation of the HEP at specific source-space nodes of the fronto-insulo-temporal networks related to affective-cognitive integration. This study is the first to assess the direct convergence among continuous triggers of viscerosensory cortical markers and emotion through dynamic stimuli presentation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Biopsies from healthy volunteers and patients under anti-TNF-alpha therapy with remittent ulcerative colitis (UC) showed higher AnxA1 expression than those with active disease. We also evaluated dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-acute colitis in TNF-alpha receptor 1 KO (INFR1-/-) strain with impaired TNF-alpha signaling and C57BL/6 (WT) mice. Although both strains developed colitis, TNFR1-/- mice showed early clinical recovery, lower myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and milder histopathological alterations. Colonic epithelium from control and DSS-treated TNFR1-/- mice showed intense AnxA1 expression and AnxA1+ CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were more frequent in TNFR1-/- animals, suggesting an extra supply of AnxA1. The pan antagonist of AnxA1 receptors exacerbated the colitis outcome in TNFR1-/- mice, supporting the pivotal role of AnxA1 in the early recovery. Our findings demonstrate that the TNF-alpha signaling reduction favors the expression and biological activity of AnxA1 in inflamed intestinal mucosa. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Knowing the results of pancreatic surgery in this group of patients would help surgeons to make therapeutic decisions. The objective is to evaluate the surgical outcomes of pancreatic resections in patients over 70 years. Methods: Retrospective study including patients undergoing pancreatic resection during the period 2009-2014. The sample was divided into 2 groups. G1: Patients under 70 years and G2: Patients older than 70 years. Surgical results between the 2 groups were evaluated. Results: Seventy three pancreatic resections were performed, 51 (70%) patients belonged to G1 and 22 (30%) to G2. There were no significant differences between G1 and G2 in terms of operative time and hospitalization days. No significant difference was obtained in the incidence of delayed gastric emptying, pancreatic fistula or biliary fistula. The overall mortality in the series was 4.1% showing difference between both groups, with 2% in G1 and 13.6% in G2 (P=.04). When a sub-analysis in G2 was made, mortality in this group occurred only in patients with significant comorbidities with ASA >= 3 (P=.004). Both groups with oncologic disease had similar overall survival and disease-free survival. Conclusions: Age should not be a limiting factor for pancreatic resections. The elderly have similar results as younger patients and their increased perioperative mortality is due to the presence of important associated comorbidities rather than age as an independent risk factor.

In 46,XY individuals, defects of gonadal differentiation, or androgen, or anti-Mullerian hormone synthesis, or action result in incomplete or absent masculinization. In severe forms, raised as females, motherhood is possible with oocyte donation if Mullerian Henan ducts have developed. In milder forms, raised as males, azoospermia or oligospermia are frequently found, however paternity has been reported. Most 46,XX patients with normal ovarian organogenesis are raised as females, and fertility might be possible after treatment.

Ectomycorrhizal fungal communities in Nothofagus nervosa (Rauli): A comparison between domesticated and naturally established specimens in a native forest of Patagonia, Argentina	FUNGAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						Cortinariaceae and Tricholomataceae; Ectomycorrhizas; Plant age; Seasonality; Southern beeches; Tree domestication	ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; VALDIVIAN TEMPERATE FOREST; SEASONAL DYNAMICS; PUMILIO FORESTS; DIFFERENT AGE; SEEDLINGS; DIVERSITY; SOIL; NURSERY; EXPLORATION	Due to its overexploitation during the past century, Nothofagus nervosa is currently included in conservation and domestication programs, in which ectomycorrhizas play an important role. We aimed to describe the abundance and diversity of ectomycorrhizal fungi (EcMF) in both domesticated and naturally established N. nervosa specimens, and to analyse the influence of age, seasonality and forest management on EcMF communities. The occurrence of arbuscular mycorrhizas (AM) and dark septate endophytes (DSE) was also investigated. Fungal diversity and taxonomic identification were assessed by morphotyping and subsequent ITS-rDNA sequencing. Plant age, seasonality and forest management influenced EcMF communities. Colonization rates were higher than 90 % in all the specimens, and were significantly higher in mature trees and in autumn. The highest EcMF richness and diversity values were registered in domesticated specimens and in autumn. Most EcMF were basidiomycetes, belonging mainly to the Cortinariaceae and Tricholomataceae. Arbuscular mycorrhizas were not detected, while DSE were present within N. nervosa roots. Our results and previously published reports showed that some EcMF are capable of colonizing different Nothofagus species. In addition, the EcMF described in natural ecosystems are different from those colonizing N. nervosa during its cultivation in the nursery. These results improve our understanding of key factors affecting EcMF communities associated with Nothofagus in native forests and nurseries (age, season, forest management, cultivation techniques), and this information is relevant for improving domestication programs.

Both are considered key variables in predicting risk of sudden cardiac death. OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to assess whether ablation might remove the primary prevention (PP) implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) indication in patients with frequent PVC. METHODS Sixty-six consecutive patients with PP-ICD indication and frequent PVC [33 (50%) men; mean age 53 13 years; 11 (17%) with ischemic heart disease] underwent PVC ablation. The ICD was withheld and the indication was reevaluated at 6 and 12 months. RESULTS LVEF progressively improved from 28% +/- 4% at baseline to 42% +/- 12% at 12 months (P < .001). New York Heart Association functional class improved from 2 patients with NYHA functional class I (3%) at baseline to 35 (53%) at 12 months (P < .001). The brain natriuretic peptide level decreased from 246 +/- 187 to 176 +/- 380 pg/mL (P = .004). The PP-ICD indication was removed in 42 patients (64%) during follow-up, from 38 (92%) of them at 6 months, showing an independent association with baseline PVC burden and successful sustained ablation. In patients with successful sustained ablation, a cutoff value of 13% PVC burden had a sensitivity of 1000 and a specificity of 93% (area under the curve 99%) for removing ICD indication postablation. No sudden cardiac deaths or malignant ventricular arrhythmias were observed. CONCLUSION In patients with frequent PVC and PP-ICD indication, ablation improves LVEF and, in most cases, allows removal of the indication. Withholding the ICD and reevaluating within 6 months of ablation seems to be a safe and appropriate strategy.

Our example, from the extreme south of South America was, at the time of our study, without firm temporal association or molecular characterization. In Tierra del Fuego, Constantinescu (1999) briefly described vertebral bone lesions compatible with TB in an undated skeleton from Myren 1 site (Chile). The remains of Myren are estimated to represent a man between 18 and 23 years old at the time of death. The objectives of this research are to extend this description, to present molecular results, to establish a radiocarbon date, and to report stable isotopic values for the remains. We provide further description of the remains, including tuberculosis-like skeletal pathology. Radiocarbon dating of 640 20 years BP attributes this individual to the precontact fourteenth-fifteenth centuries. Isotopic ratios for nitrogen and carbon from bone collagen suggest a mixed diet. Molecular results were positive for the rpoB quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays but negative for two independent IS6110 and IS1081 qPCR assays. Further testing using genomic methods to target any mycobacteria for specific identification are needed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Objective The purpose of this study is to describe the clinical and demographic profile of patients with osteoarthritis (OA) evaluated by a selected group of rheumatologists in 13 Latin American countries. Methods A descriptive, observational, cross-sectional study was conducted in 13 Latin American countries of patients with symptomatic OA. Data were collected over a 3-month period using an ad hoc questionnaire to evaluate the clinical and demographic features of OA seen by rheumatologists. Results Among the 3040 patients, their average age was 62.5 years, and female-to-male ratio was 4.8:1. Patients with body mass index of greater than 30 kg/m(2) or obesity was found in 38.2%. Approximately 88% had primary OA. Joints with OA were as follows: knee 31.2%, hand 9.5%, hand and knee 22.9%, proximal and distal interphalangeal joints (erosive OA) 6.5%, axial 6.6%, and hip 1.3%. Approximately 88.5% had radiographic severity of grade 2 or 3 on Kellgren-Lawrence scale (0-4). Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were the predominant OA treatment included in combinations with glucosamine sulfate/chondroitin and viscosupplementation. Associated comorbidities included hypertension (39%), obesity (36.3%), diabetes mellitus (12%), and without comorbidity (12.7%). Conclusions This is 1 of the largest population studies that evaluated the characteristics of OA in 3040 patients evaluated by rheumatologists in 13 Latin American countries. This study provides important data for each Latin American country to develop new health care planning in management of OA.

This has been possible because of the increase in training, competency, and knowledge, as well as the rapid progress in the US technologies. Currently, some US machines can be equipped by sophisticated software modalities (i.e., 3-dimensional US, elastosonography, automated cardiovascular software, and fusion imaging) that can augment US traditional role as a safe, fast, and easy-to-perform modality and giving it new life and increased relevance in rheumatology. In this article, we evaluated the US developments, from conventional B-mode to more sophisticated technologies, and their potential clinical impact in the field of rheumatology. Three-dimensional US can improve the accuracy of the assessment of bone erosions and the quantification of power Doppler because of its multiplanar view including coronal, axial and sagital view. Elastosonography is still looking for its role in rheumatology. Preliminary works induce us to consider it as a promise tool for the assessment of tendon pathology and skin of patients with connective tissue disorders. The automated method for the measurement of carotid intima-media thickness permits a rapid and accurate assessment. The preliminary published data showed that it is reliable, and valid compared to the traditional method; they also support the future of rheumatologists as the direct operators in evaluating the cardiovascular risk in daily practice. Fusion imaging increases the diagnostic power of US, displaying simultaneously in the monitor, the US image, and the corresponding computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging image. However, there are no sufficient data supporting its application in daily rheumatologic practice.

Implementing meta-analysis from genome-wide association studies for pork quality traits	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE			English	Article						candidate genes; genome-wide association; meat quality; meta-analysis; pigs	SINGLE NUCLEOTIDE POLYMORPHISM; UNFOLDED PROTEIN RESPONSE; BRATZLER SHEAR FORCE; PIG SKELETAL-MUSCLE; MEAT QUALITY; ENDOPLASMIC-RETICULUM; BEEF-CATTLE; MU-CALPAIN; IMPUTATION ACCURACY; GENOTYPE IMPUTATION	Pork quality plays an important role in the meat processing industry. Thus, different methodologies have been implemented to elucidate the genetic architecture of traits affecting meat quality. One of the most common and widely used approaches is to perform genome-wide association (GWA) studies. However, a limitation of many GWA in animal breeding is the limited power due to small sample sizes in animal populations. One alternative is to implement a meta-analysis of GWA (MA-GWA) combining results from independent association studies. The objective of this study was to identify significant genomic regions associated with meat quality traits by performing MA-GWA for 8 different traits in 3 independent pig populations. Results from MA-GWA were used to search for genes possibly associated with the set of evaluated traits. Data from 3 pig data sets (U.S. Meat Animal Research Center, commercial, and Michigan State University Pig Resource Population) were used. A MA was implemented by combining z-scores derived for each SNP in every population and then weighting them using the inverse of estimated variance of SNP effects. A search for annotated genes retrieved genes previously reported as candidates for shear force (calpain-1 catalytic subunit [CAPN1] and calpastatin [CAST]), as well as for ultimate pH, purge loss, and cook loss (protein kinase, AMP-activated,. 3 noncatalytic subunit [PRKAG3]). In addition, novel candidate genes were identified for intramuscular fat and cook loss (acyl-CoA synthetase family member 3 mitochondrial [ACSF3]) and for the objective measure of muscle redness, CIEa* (glycogen synthase 1, muscle [GYS1] and ferritin, light polypeptide [FTL]). Thus, implementation of MA-GWA allowed integration of results for economically relevant traits and identified novel genes to be tested as candidates for meat quality traits in pig populations.

An approach to abstract argumentation with recursive attack and support	JOURNAL OF APPLIED LOGIC			English	Article						Argumentation; Abstract argumentation; Recursive attack; Recursive support	ACCEPTABILITY; FRAMEWORKS; SEMANTICS	This work introduces the Attack Support Argumentation Framework (ASAF), an approach to abstract argumentation that allows for the representation and combination of attack and support relations. This framework extends the Argumentation Framework with Recursive Attacks (AFRA) in two ways. Firstly, it adds a support relation enabling to express support for arguments; this support can also be given to attacks, and to the support relation itself. Secondly, it extends AFRA's attack relation by allowing attacks to the aforementioned support relation. Moreover, since the support relation of the ASAF has a necessity interpretation, the ASAF also extends the Argumentation Framework with Necessities (AFN). Thus, the ASAF provides a unified framework for representing attack and support for arguments, as well as attack and support for the attack and support relations at any level. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

A labeled argumentation framework	JOURNAL OF APPLIED LOGIC			English	Article						Argumentation; Meta-level information; Algebra of argumentation labels	LOGIC; UNCERTAINTY; SYSTEMS; SUPPORT; GAMES	To increase the expressivity of an argumentation formalism, we propose adding meta-level information to the arguments in the form of labels representing quantifiable data such as reliability degree, strength measure, skill, time availability, or any other feature about arguments. The extra information attached to an argument is then used in the acceptability determination process. We present a Labeled Argumentation Framework (LAF), combining the knowledge representation capabilities provided by the Argument Interchange Format (AIF) with an Algebra of Argumentation Labels, enabling us to handle the labels associated with the arguments. These labels are propagated through an argumentative graph according to the relations of support, conflict, and aggregation between arguments. Through this process we obtain final labels attached to the arguments that are useful to determine their acceptability. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Budan, Maximiliano C.

It is, therefore, recommended the gradual replacement for second generation substrates such as lignocellulosic materials. Herein, cellulolytic bacteria were isolated from the gut content of native larvae from Lepidoptera, Coleoptera, and adults of Isoptera. Few environmental samples from the pulp and paper feedstock were also assessed. A total of 233 isolates were obtained using enrichment cultures and classic criteria. Interestingly, several halo-forming colonies were found to be bacterial consortia that presented difficulties to take apart the microbial members. Those pure isolates which hydrolyzed cellulose in larger extend (45 strains) were selected and identified by means of 16S rRNA sequence analysis. Firmicutes was the prevalent phylum (62.2%) being Bacillus spp. the most frequent genus, while Paenibacillus, Brevibacillus, Cohnella, and Staphylococcus species were less frequent. The phylum Actinobacteria (6.7%) was represented by isolates related to Agromyces spp. and Microbacterium spp. Regarding Gram-negative bacteria (31.1%), the more depicted genus was Pseudomonas spp., and members of Achromobacter spp., Enterobacter spp., and Bacteroidetes phylum were also selected. These native bacterial strains are expected to enlarge the cellulolytic toolbox for efficient biomass deconstruction.

We present here a new coarse-grained force field for the study of many protein systems. The force field, which is implemented in the context of the discrete molecular dynamics algorithm, is able to reproduce the properties of folded and unfolded proteins, in both isolation, complexed forming well-defined quaternary structures, or aggregated, thanks to its proper evaluation of protein protein interactions. The accuracy and computational efficiency of the method makes it a universal tool for the study of the structure, dynamics, and association/dissociation of proteins.

We studied age structure, age at maturity, and longevity in Odontophrynus cf. barrioi, with skeletochronology. We also determined whether sexual dimorphism in body size exists in this species, and evaluated its relation to demographic life history traits. We found that females were larger in four variables corresponding to the morphology of the head. In addition, females of O. cf. barrioi have a longer tibia-fibula and femur than males. Nevertheless, Odontophrynus cf. barrioi shows no sexual dimorphism in snout-vent length. We suggest the possibility that sexes have different growth trajectories after the onset of reproduction, as they are exposed to different selection pressures, or even predation rate, because of size differences.

Study of acyl migration during enzymatic interesterification of liquid and fully hydrogenated soybean oil	JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR CATALYSIS B-ENZYMATIC			English	Article						Lipase-catalyzed interesterification; Acyl migration; Diacylglycerols; Soybean oil; Fully hydrogenated soybean oil; Structured lipids	STRUCTURED LIPIDS; FATTY-ACIDS; OLIVE OIL; LIPASE; TRIACYLGLYCEROLS; TEMPERATURE; PRODUCTS	Lipase-catalyzed interesterification has emerged as an attractive process to obtain plastic fats because of its numerous advantages compared to the chemical reaction. The use of sn-1,3 specific lipases adds an even more interesting feature to this process, which is related to the possibility of maintaining the sn-2 fatty acid composition of natural substrates unaltered. The pursuit of this characteristic in interesterified products by sn-1,3 specific lipases could be threatened by a chemical reaction, the acyl migration whithin mono- and diacylglycerols. The aim of this study was to evaluate the occurrence of this undesired reaction in a soybean oil:fully hydrogenated soybean oil enzymatic interesterified blend. Once acyl migration was confirmed to occur, the influence of different reaction parameters -namely enzyme type and concentration, substrate ratio, and addition of hexane and temperature effect- was studied. Lipozyme TL IM demonstrated an enhancer acyl migration effect compared to Lipozyme RM IM, effect that was hypothesized to be correlated with the immobilization support material of the former (silica gel). Acyl migration was also promoted by the increase of biocatalyst concentration in reaction media. On the contrary, the presence of hexane, together with a decrease in temperature reaction, reduced its occurrence. A temperature effect analysis performed in solvent reaction media demonstrated its promoter effect on acyl migration. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

About the role of typical spacer/crosslinker on the design of efficient magnetic biocatalysts based on nanosized magnetite	JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR CATALYSIS B-ENZYMATIC			English	Article						Enzyme immobilization; CALB; Magnetic support; Biocatalyst; Glutaraldehyde; Mechanism	CANDIDA-ANTARCTICA; LIPASE-B; IMMOBILIZATION PROTOCOL; ENZYME IMMOBILIZATION; SUPPORT ACTIVATION; NANOPARTICLES; GLUTARALDEHYDE; PROTEINS; IMPROVE; TOOL	The immobilization of Candida antarcdca lipase B (CALB) was carried out using glutaraldehyde (GLUT) and/or 3-aminopropyl-triethoxisilane (APTS). The aim of this work was to elucidate the role of these crosslinkers/functionalizers on the efficiency of the prepared nanosized catalysts in solvent-free oleic acid esterification. A series of biocatalysts were prepared in presence or absence of GLUT and APTS. The impact of the amount of initial CALB was also explored. An experimental design was utilized to study the variables that maximize biocatalyst activity. A strong dependence of enzymatic activity with the nominal amount of GLUT as well as the final protein/CALB loading was found. Nominal quantity of APTS did not affect catalyst's activity when used in combination with GLUT. Additional studies demonstrated that stability during storage was mainly dependent on the enzyme loading. The optimum biocatalyst was reused six cycles without mass loss. Biocatalyst's performance decreased with reuse. Mechanisms justifying these results were proposed. The role of GLUT and APTS on stability during storage and on differences between initial enzymatic activity and the performance in the reaction after two months was discussed. The problem of mixed interaction of CALB (covalent bonding plus simple adsorption) was carefully addressed to explain leaching of the lipase. Leaching and stability on storage should be included in the analysis of modifiers impact when support's modifiers are used. The fresh and stored biocatalyst enzymatic activity has to be addressed looking at the practical aspects of implementation in technological settings. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.

However, little is known regarding its contribution to aversive memory consolidation. Here we demonstrate that neural activity and protein synthesis are required in the dorsal mPFC for memory formation of a conditioned taste aversion (CTA) task and that this region is involved in the retrieval of recent and remote long-term CTA memory. In addition, both NMDA receptor and CaMKII activity in dorsal mPFC are needed for CTA memory consolidation, highlighting the complexity of mPFC functions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Positive modulation of a neutral declarative memory by a threatening social event	NEUROBIOLOGY OF LEARNING AND MEMORY			English	Article						Neutral declarative memory; Memory improvement; Memory persistence; Pre-learning stress; Psychosocial stress; Autonomic nervous system	NERVOUS-SYSTEM ACTIVITY; PSYCHOSOCIAL STRESS; EPISODIC MEMORY; CORTISOL; RESPONSES; CONSOLIDATION; PERFORMANCE; ELEVATIONS; RETRIEVAL; SPEECH	Memories can be altered by negative or arousing experiences due to the activation of the stress-responsive sympatho-adrenal-medullary axis (SYM). Here, we used a neutral declarative memory that was acquired during multi-trial training to determine the effect of a threatening event on memory without emotional valence. To this end, participants received a new threatening social protocol before learning pairs of meaningless syllables and were tested either 15 min, 2 days or 8 days after acquisition. We first demonstrated that this threatening social situation activates not only the SYM axis (Experiment 1) and the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA; Experiment 2), but also, it improves the acquisition or early consolidation of the syllable pairs (Experiment 3). This improvement is not a transient effect; it can be observed after the memory is consolidated. Furthermore, this modulation increases the persistence of memory (Experiment 4). Thus, it is possible to affect memories with specific events that contain unrelated content and a different valence. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

We report a series of anatomical differences between repeated skull bones of Mapusaurus, which we interpret as produced by peramorphic heterochronic processes. The materials analyzed include maxillae, lacrimals, dentaries, and isolated teeth. Most of the differences were recorded in the maxilla, the most noticeable change being the reduction of the pneumaticity. We found that some of the synapomorphic characters of derived carcharodontosaurids appear to be the result of peramorphic heterochronies, as in the strongly ornamented facial bones, and the single opening in the anteroventral corner of the antorbital fossa in the maxilla.

Morphology of the forelimb of Psilopterus bachmanni (Aves, Cariamiformes) (Early Miocene of Patagonia)	PALAEONTOLOGISCHE ZEITSCHRIFT			English	Article						Psilopterus; Santa Cruz Formation; Forelimb; Carpometacarpus; Phorusrhacids	BIRD; TERATORNITHIDAE; ARGENTINA; TAXONOMY; SIZE	Psilopterines are the smallest and most gracile predatory birds belonging to the large terrestrial Phorusrhacidae, which were abundant during the South American Tertiary. Two taxa are recognized from the Santacrucian (late Early Miocene) beds of Argentinian Patagonia: Psilopterus lemoinei and Psilopterus bachmanni. Although the first species was recently redescribed and is well known, in the case of P. bachmanni, the smaller of the two, the forelimb skeleton was virtually unknown until recently. The fossils described herein come from the coast of Santa Cruz Province, and were recovered from the middle levels of the Estancia La Costa Member, Santa Cruz Formation. The specimen includes associated bones of both forelimbs and a fragmentary furcula. The manus of this species, previously unknown, is described here for the first time: the os carpi ulnare and radiale are very stout bones, the carpometacarpus has processi extensorius and alularis very marked and stout and the os metacarpale majus and phalanges digiti majoris are very robust, and the phalanx digiti minoris is flattened. It has been proposed that some species belonging to Psilopterus were able to fly in a clumsy manner. While this work is not intended to certify this condition through complex models, some considerations of the paleobiology of P. bachmanni based on manus movement capabilities and body mass are presented. It seems plausible that P. bachmanni would have had both cursorial and flying capabilities. The information provided here represents an effort to discuss features previously unknown in phorusrhacids and to provide new data that may be useful in future systematic, morpho-functional and evolutionary studies.

The latter are due to multiple scatterings of laser photons inside the cavity and become relevant when the laser pump is sufficiently strong to overcome photon decay. We study the stationary states of ions coupled with a mode of a standing-wave cavity as a function of the cavity and laser parameters, when the typical length scales of the two self-organizing processes, Coulomb crystallization and photon-mediated interactions, are incommensurate. The dynamics are frustrated and in specific limiting cases can be cast in terms of the Frenkel-Kontorova model, which reproduces features of friction in one dimension. We numerically recover the sliding and pinned phases. For strong cavity nonlinearities, they are in general separated by bistable regions where superlubric and stick-slip dynamics coexist. The cavity, moreover, acts as a thermal reservoir and can cool the chain vibrations to temperatures controlled by the cavity parameters and by the ions' phase. These features are imprinted in the radiation emitted by the cavity, which is readily measurable in state-of-the-art setups of cavity quantum electrodynamics.

Genome of Rhodnius prolixus, an insect vector of Chagas disease, reveals unique adaptations to hematophagy and parasite infection	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						Rhodnius prolixus; genome; hematophagy; immunity; Chagas disease	HEME-BINDING PROTEIN; ANOPHELES-GAMBIAE; CAENORHABDITIS-ELEGANS; BLOODSUCKING INSECT; TRIATOMA-INFESTANS; CARBON-DIOXIDE; GRAN CHACO; EVOLUTION; REDUVIIDAE; HEMIPTERA	Rhodnius prolixus not only has served as a model organism for the study of insect physiology, but also is a major vector of Chagas disease, an illness that affects approximately seven million people worldwide. We sequenced the genome of R. prolixus, generated assembled sequences covering 95% of the genome (similar to 702 Mb), including 15,456 putative protein-coding genes, and completed comprehensive genomic analyses of this obligate blood-feeding insect. Although immune-deficiency (IMD)-mediated immune responses were observed, R. prolixus putatively lacks key components of the IMD pathway, suggesting a reorganization of the canonical immune signaling network. Although both Toll and IMD effectors controlled intestinal microbiota, neither affected Trypanosoma cruzi, the causal agent of Chagas disease, implying the existence of evasion or tolerance mechanisms. R. prolixus has experienced an extensive loss of selenoprotein genes, with its repertoire reduced to only two proteins, one of which is a selenocysteine-based glutathione peroxidase, the first found in insects. The genome contained actively transcribed, horizontally transferred genes from Wolbachia sp., which showed evidence of codon use evolution toward the insect use pattern. Comparative protein analyses revealed many lineage-specific expansions and putative gene absences in R. prolixus, including tandem expansions of genes related to chemoreception, feeding, and digestion that possibly contributed to the evolution of a blood-feeding lifestyle. The genome assembly and these associated analyses provide critical information on the physiology and evolution of this important vector species and should be instrumental for the development of innovative disease control methods.

However, it is unclear whether other mechanisms also facilitate the elongation of UV-damaged DNA. We wondered if Rad51 recombinase (Rad51), a factor that escorts replication forks, aids replication across UV lesions. We found that depletion of Rad51 impairs S-phase progression and increases cell death after UV irradiation. Interestingly, Rad51 and the TLS polymerase pol eta modulate the elongation of nascent DNA in different ways, suggesting that DNA elongation after UV irradiation does not exclusively rely on TLS events. In particular, Rad51 protects the DNA synthesized immediately before UV irradiation from degradation and avoids excessive elongation of nascent DNA after UV irradiation. In Rad51-depleted samples, the degradation of DNA was limited to the first minutes after UV irradiation and required the exonuclease activity of the double strand break repair nuclease (Mre11). The persistent dysregulation of nascent DNA elongation after Rad51 knockdown required Mre11, but not its exonuclease activity, and PrimPol, a DNA polymerase with primase activity. By showing a crucial contribution of Rad51 to the synthesis of nascent DNA, our results reveal an unanticipated complexity in the regulation of DNA elongation across UV-damaged templates.

Effect of functional groups on physicochemical and mechanical behavior of biocompatible macroporous hydrogels	REACTIVE & FUNCTIONAL POLYMERS			English	Article						Macroporous hydrogel; Mechanical anisotropy; Cryogelation; Water states; Fibroblasts	NANOCOMPOSITE HYDROGELS; BIOMEDICAL APPLICATIONS; POLY(VINYL ALCOHOL); DRUG-DELIVERY; CELL; TEMPERATURE; NETWORK; POLY(N-ISOPROPYLACRYLAMIDE); CRYOGELATION; FABRICATION	The increasing interest in studying the properties of biocompatible hydrogels is due to their possible applications in bioengineering. Properties of hydrogels based on N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM) and the effect caused by copolymerization with 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulfonic acid (AMPS) or N-acryloyl-tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (HMA) were investigated. Hydrogels were synthesized by free radical polymerization at room temperature or by cryogelation at -18 degrees C. The presence of different functional groups (isopropyl, -SO3-, and -OH) and thermal conditions of polymerization affected the morphology and physicochemical and mechanical properties of hydrogels. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed the presence of macropores created by cryogelation with the morphology of the pores dependent on chemical composition of the copolymer. Poly(NIPAM-co-HMA) has spherical and isolated pores, whereas PNIPAM and Poly(NIPAM-co-AMPS) showed ellipsoidal interconnected pores. Three different water states were detected by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), indicating the presence of nano- and macropores. Elastic modulus (E) was measured to be around 3-6.5 kPa by uniaxial compression. However, higher E values (20-30 kPa) and an anisotropic mechanical response were observed for PNIPAM and PNIPAM-co-AMPS hydrogels with ellipsoidal pores, a behavior that is almost similar to that of cartilage and bone tissues. Cytocompatibility studies using bovine fibroblasts (BFs) indicated good cell attachment and proliferation on PNIPAM-based hydrogel surfaces, although initially the cell adhesion varied depending on the composition of the surface. These hydrogels could be an interesting choice for the development of scaffolds in tissue engineering. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

There is a strong causal relationship between infection and preterm births. Intrauterine infection elicits an immune response involving the release of inflammatory mediators like cytokines and prostaglandins (PG) that trigger uterine contractions and parturition events. Anandamide (AEA) is an endogenous ligand for the cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2. Similarly to PG, endocannabinoids are implicated in different aspects of reproduction, such as maintenance of pregnancy and parturition. Little is known about the involvement of endocannabinoids on the onset of labor in an infectious milieu. Here, using a mouse model of preterm labor induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), we explored changes on the expression of components of endocannabinoid system (ECS). We have also determined whether AEA and CB antagonists alter PG production that induces labor. We observed an increase in uterine N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine-specific phospholipase D expression (NAPE-PLD, the enzyme that synthesizes AEA) upon LPS treatment. Activity of catabolic enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) did not change significantly. In addition, we also found that LPS modulated uterine cannabinoid receptors expression by downregulating Cb2 mRNA levels and upregulating CB1 protein expression. Furthermore, LPS and AEA induced PGF2a augmentation, and this was reversed by antagonizing CB1 receptor. Collectively, our results suggest that ECS may be involved in the mechanism by which infection causes preterm birth.

In this paper, we focus on the population of Mexican mobile phone users. We first present an observational study of mobile phone usage according to gender and age groups. We are able to detect significant differences in phone usage among different subgroups of the population. We then study the performance of different machine learning (ML) methods to predict demographic features (namely, age and gender) of unlabeled users by leveraging individual calling patterns, as well as the structure of the communication graph. We show how a specific implementation of a diffusion model, harnessing the graph structure, has significantly better performance over other node-based standard ML methods. We provide details of the methodology together with an analysis of the robustness of our results to changes in the model parameters. Furthermore, by carefully examining the topological relations of the training nodes (seed nodes) to the rest of the nodes in the network, we find topological metrics which have a direct influence on the performance of the algorithm.

Dynamics of soil chemical properties in shifting cultivation systems in the tropics: a meta-analysis	SOIL USE AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Shifting cultivation; slash-and-burn; swidden; soil chemistry; meta-analysis	SLASH-AND-BURN; FOREST-AGRICULTURE FRONTIERS; ECOLOGICAL SUSTAINABILITY; SWIDDEN CULTIVATION; SOUTHEAST-ASIA; RAIN-FOREST; FERTILITY; CARBON; CHRONOSEQUENCE; CONSEQUENCES	The forest cultivation system (slash-and-burn or shifting cultivation) has contributed to the transformation of social systems since the early Neolithic period. Despite being considered by conservationists and public policymakers as a system of low productivity that generates environmental degradation and contributes to the maintenance of rural poverty, the shifting cultivation system (SCS) is being declared a practice that is highly ecologically and economically efficient. Such dichotomy of opinions is the consequence of the disparate results of studies assessing the effects of SCS on soil properties of rainforests throughout the last three decades. To circumvent this apparent inconsistency, we used a systematic quantitative review method (meta-analysis), with the objective of integrating and synthesizing the data published in the literature to assess the overall effects of SCS on soil chemical properties. Four variables traditionally assessed in primary studies were chosen for the meta-analyses: pH, cation exchange capacity (CEC), total carbon (Total C) and total nitrogen (Total N). Our results show that pH values increase under SCS conditions, while Total N and C content are significantly reduced under SCS. No significant impacts are observed on CEC. Our results on pH and CEC support the position from researchers who argue for the sustainability of SCS and highlight the importance of evaluating the soil system as a soil/vegetation complex. Also, our results indicate that soil chemical properties under SCS scenarios are better conserved and more readily recoverable, provided there is a rather longer fallow period than has been traditionally employed.

J	Carman, CC				Carlos Carman, Christian			The planetary increase of brightness during retrograde motion: An explanandum constructed ad explanantem	STUDIES IN HISTORY AND PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE			English	Article						Epicycle; Deferent; Homocentric spheres; Brightness change	DID PTOLEMY; ASTRONOMY; MOON	In Ancient Greek two models were proposed for explaining the planetary motion: the homocentric spheres of Eudoxus and the Epicycle and Deferent System. At least in a qualitative way, both models could explain the retrograde motion, the most challenging phenomenon to be explained using circular motions. Nevertheless, there is another explanandum: during retrograde motion the planets increase their brightness. It is natural to interpret a change of brightness, i.e., of apparent size, as a change in distance. Now, while according to the Eudoxian model the planet is always equidistant from the earth, according to the epicycle and deferent system, the planet changes its distance from the earth, approaching to it during retrograde motion, just as observed. So, it is usually affirmed that the main reason for the rejection of Eudoxus' homocentric spheres in favor of the epicycle and deferent system was that the first cannot explain the manifest planetary increase of brightness during retrograde motion, while the second can.

Influence of random point defects introduced by proton irradiation on the flux creep rates and magnetic field dependence of the critical current density J(c) of co-evaporated GdBa2Cu3O7-delta coated conductors	SUPERCONDUCTOR SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						coated conductors; vortex dynamics; proton irradiation	HIGH-TEMPERATURE SUPERCONDUCTORS; BA-CU-O; COLUMNAR DEFECTS; VORTEX CREEP; THIN-FILMS; YBA2CU3O7-X; CRYSTALS	We report the influence of random point defects introduced by 3 MeV proton irradiation (doses of 0.5 x 10(16), 1 x 10(16), 2 x 10(16) and 6 x 10(16) cm(-2)) on the vortex dynamics of co-evaporated 1.3 mu m thick, GdBa2Cu3O7-delta coated conductors. Our results indicate that the inclusion of additional random point defects reduces the low field and enhances the in-field critical current densities J(c). The main in-field J(c) enhancement takes place below 40 K, which is in agreement with the expectations for pinning by random point defects. In addition, our data show a slight though clear increase in flux creep rates as a function of irradiation fluence. Maley analysis indicates that this increment can be associated with a reduction in the exponent mu characterizing the glassy behavior.

Characterization of bovine MHC class II DRB3 diversity in South American Holstein cattle populations	TISSUE ANTIGENS			English	Article						BoLA-DRB3; genetic diversity; Holstein; principal components analysis; tropical disease resistance	MAJOR HISTOCOMPATIBILITY COMPLEX; HETEROZYGOTE ADVANTAGE; LYMPHOCYTE ANTIGEN; JAPANESE SHORTHORN; BOLA-DRB3 ALLELES; LEUKOCYTE ANTIGEN; VIRUS-INFECTION; CREOLE CATTLE; DAIRY-CATTLE; HEAT-STRESS	Holstein cattle dominate the global milk production industry because of their outstanding milk production, however, this breed is susceptible to tropical endemic pathogens and suffers from heat stress and thus fewer Holstein populations are raised in tropical areas. The bovine major histocompatibility complex (BoLA)-DRB3 class II gene is used as a marker for disease and immunological traits, and its polymorphism has been studied extensively in Holstein cattle from temperate and cold regions. We studied the genetic diversity of the BoLA-DRB3 gene in South American Holstein populations to determine whether tropical populations have diverged from those bred in temperate and cold regions by selection and/or crossbreeding with local native breeds. We specifically studied Exon 2 of this gene from 855 South American Holstein individuals by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) sequence-based typing method. We found a high degree of gene diversity at the allelic (N-a > 20 and H-e > 0.87) and molecular (pi > 0.080) levels, but a low degree of population structure (F-ST = 0.009215). A principal components analysis and tree showed that the Bolivian subtropical population had the largest genetic divergence compared with Holsteins bred in temperate or cold regions, and that this population was closely related to Bolivian Creole cattle. Our results suggest that Holstein genetic divergence can be explained by selection and/or gene introgression from local germplasms. This is the first examination of BoLA-DRB3 in Holsteins adapted to tropical environments, and contributes to an ongoing effort to catalog bovine MHC allele frequencies by breed and location.

Effects of atmospheric correction of Landsat imagery on lake water clarity assessment	ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH			English	Article						Atmospheric correction; Landsat; Reservoir; 6S model; Water clarity	RIO-TERCERO RESERVOIR; THEMATIC MAPPER; TM DATA; SOLAR SPECTRUM; QUALITY; ARGENTINA; ETM+; CHLOROPHYLL; CALIBRATION; RETRIEVAL	Empirical relationships between Landsat data and water clarity expressed in terms of Secchi disk transparency (SDT) have been widely used for monitoring and assessment of water quality. The atmosphere affects differently sensor bands depending on the waveband, thus affecting the relationships obtained from top-of-atmosphere reflectance. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether the reliability of water clarity can be improved applying atmospheric correction of Landsat imagery. Further, a general predictive algorithm to determine water clarity in the reservoir was developed. Samples of SDT were taken from Rio Tercero reservoir (Argentina). Landsat images were atmospheric corrected using the 6S code. Estimated values of SDT with and without atmospheric correction were compared for their differences. Results suggested that atmospheric corrected values of Landsat band 3 and the ratio 1/3 proved to be the best predictor of water clarity in the reservoir (R-2 = 0.84). Using the 6S code we demonstrate the usefulness of atmospheric correction to Landsat data since water clarity algorithm using surface reflectance was more reliable than the top-of atmosphere reflectance model.

Free availability of high-energy foods led to energy over-ingestion and protein under-ingestion in choice-fed broilers	ANIMAL SCIENCE JOURNAL			English	Article						choice feeding; diet selection; high-energy foods; ingestive behavior; nutritional balance	APPARENT ILEAL DIGESTIBILITY; DIET SELECTION; METABOLIZABLE ENERGY; EXPERIMENTAL-DESIGN; GEOMETRIC ANALYSIS; TROPICAL CLIMATE; SELF-SELECTION; FAT DEPOSITION; AMINO-ACIDS; CHICKENS	The objective of this study was to compare energy and protein content of the diet selected by choice-fed broilers with that of broilers fed a balanced diet. One hundred and eighty 1-day-old male broilers were randomly assigned in groups of 10 to one of three experimental treatments (n=6). Control broilers were fed a standard balanced diet, whereas choice-fed broilers were fed three foods which were more concentrated (Choice C+ treatment) or less concentrated (Choice C- treatment) in protein, carbohydrate or fat. We evaluated food intake behavior, nutrient intake, and performance parameters of broilers from 2 to 7 weeks of age. Choice C+ broilers showed enhanced preference for the high-fat food, which led to higher energy intake and lower protein intake than those of control broilers at 2 to 4 weeks of age. Body weight, weight gain and feed conversion efficiency were negatively affected by diet selection of Choice C+ broilers. Choice C- broilers selected a balanced diet, and showed performance parameters similar to those of control broilers. Our results supported the hypothesis that free availability of high-energy foods bias ingestive behavior of choice-fed broilers toward selecting a diet with higher energy and lower protein than needed for normal growth.

When H-o is the isotropic Harmonic oscillator the spectrum is real for all g because H is isospectral to H-o + g(2)/2. When H-o is the Hydrogen atom then infinitely many eigenvalues are complex for all g.

DesignSecondary analysis of women after postpartum haemorrhage, either randomly allocated to, or opting for expectant management. SettingThirty-seven hospitals in the Netherlands. PopulationA total of 261 randomised and 362 nonrandomised women. MethodsWe developed prediction models to assess the need for RBC transfusion: one using clinical variables (model 1), and one extended with scores on the HRQoL-measures Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI) and EuroQol-5D (model 2). Model performance was assessed by discrimination and calibration. Models were internally validated with bootstrapping techniques to correct for overfitting. Main outcome measuresEscape RBC transfusion. ResultsSeventy-five women (12%) received escape RBC transfusion. Independent predictors of escape RBC transfusion (model 1) were primiparity, multiple pregnancy, total blood loss during delivery and haemoglobin concentration postpartum. Maternal age, body mass index, ethnicity, education, medical indication of pregnancy, mode of delivery, preterm delivery, placental removal, perineal laceration, Apgar score and breastfeeding intention had no predictive value. Addition of HRQoL-scores (model 2), significantly improved the model's discriminative ability: c-statistics of model 1 and 2 were 0.65 (95% CI 0.58-0.72) and 0.72 (95% CI 0.65-0.79), respectively. The calibration of both models was good. ConclusionsIn postpartum anaemic women, several clinical variables predict the need for escape RBC transfusion. Adding HRQoL-scores improves model performance. After external validation, the extended model may be an important tool for counselling and decision making in clinical practice.	[Prick, B.

For example, dendroecological studies aiming at relating tree establishment with past climate should consider the possibility that many plants might not survive to be recorded at the date of the study. A standard approach to deal with this data loss consists in fitting an exponential decay curve to the observed age structure and using the residuals of this fit as a proxy of tree establishment. Here, we show that hierarchical Bayesian analysis (HBA), where tree establishment is modeled as a latent variable, can outperform the standard approach. We illustrate the use of HBA with a simulation study in which the goal is to infer population dynamics from dendrochronological age structures. Both methods are also used to analyze empirical data from expanding Alnus acuminata Kunth forests in northwestern Argentina. The simulation study showed that the standard approach underestimated the association between rainfall and tree establishment. The HBA was unbiased and had narrower uncertainty around estimates. In the empirical study, the HBA detected effects of rainfall on tree establishment, which were deemed not significant by the standard approach. Besides these advantages, the flexibility of the HBA should allow for the analysis of more complex (and realistic) models.

We previously reported that this compartment is perturbed in tuberculosis (TB) patients, as reflected by the expansion of CD16(+) monocytes along with disease severity. Whether this unbalance is beneficial or detrimental to host defense remains to be elucidated. Here in the context of active TB, we demonstrate that human monocytes are predisposed to differentiate towards an anti-inflammatory (M2-like) macrophage activation program characterized by the CD16(+)CD163(+)MerTK(+) pSTAT3(+) phenotype and functional properties such as enhanced protease-dependent motility, pathogen permissivity and immunomodulation. This process is dependent on STAT3 activation, and loss-of-function experiments point towards a detrimental role in host defense against TB. Importantly, we provide a critical correlation between the abundance of the CD16(+)CD163(+)MerTK(+)pSTAT3(+) cells and the progression of the disease either at the local level in a non-human primate tuberculous granuloma context, or at the systemic level through the detection of the soluble form of CD163 in human sera. Collectively, this study argues for the pathogenic role of the CD16(+)CD163(+)MerTK(+)pSTAT3(+) monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation program and its potential as a target for TB therapy, and promotes the detection of circulating CD163 as a potential biomarker for disease progression and monitoring of treatment efficacy.

Recently, therapeutic strategies have incorporated chemosensitizing agents to improve the tumoral response to this drug. ETO creates DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) via inhibition of DNA topoisomerase II (Top2). To repair DSB, homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), involving D-NHEJ (dependent of the catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase, DNA-PKcs) and B-NHEJ (backup repair pathway) are activated. We evaluated the progression of the DNA damage induced by the Top2 poison ETO in G2 phase of human HeLa cells after chemical inhibition of DNA-PKcs with NU7026. Compared to ETO treatment alone, this combined treatment resulted in a twofold higher rate of chromatid breaks and exchanges when analysis was performed in the following metaphase. Moreover, when analysis was performed in the second metaphase following treatment, increases in the percentage of micronuclei with H2AX (biomarker for DSB) foci in binucleated cells and dicentric chromosomes were seen. In post-mitotic G1 phase, a close association between unresolved DSB and meiotic recombination 11 homolog A (MRE11) signals was observed, demonstrating the contribution of MRE11 in the DSB repair by B-NHEJ. Hence, chemical inhibition of DNA-PKcs impaired both D-NHEJ and HR repair pathways, altering the maintenance of chromosomal integrity and cell proliferation. Our results suggest that the chemosensitizing effectiveness of the DNA-PKcs inhibitor and the survival rate of aberrant cells may contribute to the development of therapy-related tumors.

J	Arias, PA; Fu, R; Vera, C; Rojas, M				Arias, Paola A.; Fu, Rong; Vera, Carolina; Rojas, Maisa			A correlated shortening of the North and South American monsoon seasons in the past few decades	CLIMATE DYNAMICS			English	Article						Southern Amazon wet season; North American monsoon; South American monsoon; North Atlantic subtropical high; Cross-equatorial flow; Global warming	SURFACE TEMPERATURE ANOMALIES; ATLANTIC MULTIDECADAL OSCILLATION; SUMMER RAINFALL VARIABILITY; SOUTHWESTERN UNITED-STATES; TROPICAL PACIFIC-OCEAN; LA-NINA EVENTS; EL-NINO; INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY; CLIMATE VARIABILITY; PRECIPITATION REGIME	Our observational analysis shows that the wet seasons of the American monsoon systems have shortened since 1978 due to correlated earlier retreats of the North American monsoon (NAM) and late onsets of the southern Amazon wet season, an important part of the South American monsoon (SAM). These changes are related to the combination of the global sea surface temperature (SST) warming mode, the El Nio-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), the westward shift of the North Atlantic subtropical high (NASH), and the enhancement of Pacific South American and Pacific North American wave train patterns, which induces variations of the regional circulation at interannual and decadal scales. The joint contributions from these forcing factors are associated with a stronger and more equatorward regional Hadley cell, which enhances convergence towards the equator, strengthening and possibly delaying the retreat of the tropical part of the NAM. This in turn accelerates the demise of the northern NAM and delays the reversal of the cross-equatorial flow over South America, reducing moisture transport to the SAM and delaying its onset. In addition, the thermodynamic response to warming appears to cause local drier land conditions over both regions, reinforcing the observed changes in these monsoons. Although previous studies have identified the isolated influence of the regional Hadley cell, ENSO, AMO, global SST warming, and NASH on the NAM, the correlated changes between NAM and SAM through variations of the cross-equatorial flow had not been established before.

Phytotoxicity and genotoxicity assessment of imazethapyr herbicide using a battery of bioassays	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH			English	Article						Imazethapyr; Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata; Lactuca sativa; Ames test; Allium cepa; Toxicity; Genotoxicity	CHROMOSOME-ABERRATION; ALLIUM-CEPA; LACTUCA-SATIVA; SOMATIC-CELLS; COMET ASSAY; VICIA-FABA; TOXICITY; WATER; IMIDAZOLINONE; MUTAGENICITY	The imazethapyr herbicide (formulation Verosil (R)) was evaluated for phytotoxicity and genotoxicity using a battery of bioassays: (1) the growth inhibition of the green alga Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, (2) the root growth and germination of the higher plant Lactuca sativa, (3) the genetic damage using the Salmonella/microsome test, and (4) the aneugenic and clastogenic effects on Allium cepa. The Verosil (R) formulation was highly toxic to the non-target green alga (median effective concentration (EC50) = 1.05 +/- 0.05 mg active ingredient (a.i.) L-1), and concentrations above 10 mg a.i. L-1 inhibited root elongation in lettuce: relative growth index (RGI) between 0.28 +/- 0.01 and 0.66 +/- 0.10. No genotoxic effect was observed in Salmonella typhimurium at 100 mg a.i. L-1, either with or without the microsomal fraction. However, significant differences in the frequency of chromosomal aberrations in anaphases and telophases (bridges, chromosome fragments, and vagrants) were observed in A. cepa at concentrations between 0.01 and 1 mg a.i. L-1 with respect to the control. The frequencies of micronuclei showed significant differences with respect to the control at concentrations between 0.001 and 0.1 mg a.i. L-1. A very high mitotic index (MI = 93.8 +/- 5.8) was observed associated with a high number of cells in the prophase stage at 100 mg a.i. L-1, indicating cytotoxicity. These results showed that imazethapyr is toxic to the non-target populations in both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. This herbicide might also exert clastogenic and aneugenic mitotic damage in higher plants. Therefore, the imazethapyr formulation may constitute an environmental risk to plants.

Butyltins, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, organochlorine pesticides, and polychlorinated biphenyls in sediments and bivalve mollusks in a mid-latitude environment from the Patagonian coastal zone	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Butyltins; PAHs; Organochlorines; Pollutant sources; sediment quality	PERSISTENT ORGANIC POLLUTANTS; ORGANOTIN COMPOUNDS; TEMPORAL DISTRIBUTION; ESTUARINE SEDIMENTS; PHENYLTIN COMPOUNDS; AEGEAN SEA; CONTAMINATION; BAY; PAHS; PCBS	Butyltins (BTs), polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were assessed in a mid-latitude environment of the Patagonian coast, distant from significant pollutant sources. Bioaccumulation processes through bottom sediment resuspension were suggested by BTs level (expressed as ng of tin [Sn]g(-1) dry wt) found in surface sediment (<limit of detection [LOD]-166.5ng [Sn]g(-1) dry wt) and bivalve mollusks (29.4-206.0 ng [Sn] g(-1) dry wt); whereas imposex incidence was only 15% in the gastropod Pareuthria plumbea collected near a harbor. Low hydrocarbon pollution was found in sediments and bivalves with Sigma PAHs(16) ranging from <LOD to 94.9ngg(-1) dry weight and from <LOD to 54.9ngg(-1) dry weight, respectively. Values were typical of locations distant from pollutant sources and showed different compositional patterns for both substrates. However, concentrations for some individual PAHs in sediments were found over the threshold effect level. On average, sigma PCB did not exceed the sediment quality guidelines being 0.57 +/- 0.88ngg(-1) dry weight in sediments and 0.41 +/- 0.26ngg(-1) dry weight in bivalves. Average sigma OCPs in sediments were 0.53 +/- 0.34ngg(-1) dry weight and ranged from <LOD to 0.22ngg(-1) dry weight in bivalves, showing a different pattern and suggesting a different accumulation pathway as was found for PAHs. Although both discrete and atmospheric sources can be considered for PAHs, organochlorines pollution was clearly related to atmospheric global transport, indicating that in the studied area, OCPs and PCBs experience permanent or temporal deposition during their migration to southern zones.

Cox-1 gene sequence of Spirometra in Pampas foxes from Argentina	HELMINTHOLOGIA			English	Article						non-invasive methods; wild mammals; Diphyllobothriidae eggs; PCR; cytochrome C oxidase subunit 1 gene	MOLECULAR-IDENTIFICATION; MITOCHONDRIAL-DNA; SPARGANOSIS; DIPHYLLOBOTHRIIDAE; PARASITE; REGIONS; CESTODA; RDNA	The parasites of the genus Spirometra belong to one of the twelve genera of the family Diphyllobothriidae, with several species of zoonotic importance whose definitive hosts are carnivorous mammals. In Argentina, few reports have described these parasites in wild carnivores. Morphological studies of the adult stage obtained from necropsy allow the distinction between Diphyllobothrium and Spirometra. A less invasive method of identification is the analysis of the parasite eggs; however, the morphometric similarities between close genera and species and alterations in egg preservation affect the identification. In Argentina, molecular tools have been used as a non-invasive and accurate method to increase the information about Spirometra and to improve its identification. In the present study, DNA was extracted from Spirometra eggs from Pampas foxes and a 450-bp fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome C oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) gene was sequenced. The sequence obtained, which is the first Spirometra DNA sequence from Argentina, was deposited at GenBank. Comparison by BLASTN analysis between the sequence obtained and the sequences from GenBank showed 93 % identity with S. proliferum and 89% with S. erinaceieuropaei.	[Petrigh, R. S.; Fugassa, M.

The only way to identify the species/genotypes is through molecular analyses. In Chile, only one study has reported Trichinella larvae in a cougar, but the species of Trichinella was not identified. In this work, the finding of Trichinella larvae in a cougar, together with their genotypic identification, is the first documentation of such in Chile. The cougar was found run over by a vehicle in the Biobio Region. Larvae were isolated following artificial digestion of the diaphragm and analyzed by means of multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A PCR product of 173 base pairs allowed for the classification of the larvae as T. spiralis. It is the first record of the species in Chilean wildlife. This finding in Chile is interesting in terms of human health, suggesting a possible role of the cougar as a reservoir for this parasite	[Landaeta-Aqueveque, C.; Martin, N.; Gonzalez-Acuna, D.; Sandoval, D.] Univ Concepcion, Fac Ciencias Vet, Chillan, Chile; [Krivokapich, S.; Gatti, G.

Critical care nursing organizations and activities: a fourth worldwide review	INTERNATIONAL NURSING REVIEW			English	Article						Intensive Care; International Issues; Clinical Specialist; Nursing; International Health Nursing; Nursing Leadership	MEDICATION; ERRORS	AimTo examine the activities and concerns of critical care nurses and professional critical care nursing organizations around the world and to identify expectations held of nursing leaders and policy makers to help address their concerns. BackgroundThis study is the fourth worldwide review of its type. Previous surveys were undertaken in 2001, 2005 and 2009. MethodsAn online descriptive survey was emailed to 88 potential participants from countries with critical care nursing organizations or known critical care nursing leaders. Responses were downloaded into Survey Monkey (Version 22) and analysed by geographical region and income level. ResultsFifty-nine respondents from 58 countries completed the questionnaire, of whom 43 had critical care nursing organizations established in their countries and 29 were members of the World Federation of Critical Care Nurses. The services provided by the organizations to be of most value were national conferences, website, professional representation, and practice standards and guidelines. Professional policies had been developed by some organizations on workforce, education and practice, while almost half provided their members with either a newsletter or journal. Collectively, the most important issues for critical care nurses were working conditions, provision of formal practice guidelines and competencies, staffing levels and access to quality education programmes. ConclusionsImportant issues continue to challenge the specialty of critical care nursing as new developments, priorities, clinical issues and other global events and influences impact critical care nursing worldwide. Implications for Nursing and Health PolicyThis study will help guide nursing leaders and policy makers to address the needs of critical care nurses and their patients. Collaborative approaches between the specialty, nursing leaders and health policy advisors will assist to inform appropriate change in areas recommended for further action.

The influence of fracture connectivity on seismic attenuation has, however, recently, only been investigated. Numerical compressibility and shear tests based on Biot's quasi-static poro-elastic equations illustrate that an important manifestation of WIFF arises in the presence of fracture connectivity. The corresponding energy loss, which can be significant for both P- and S-waves, is mainly due to fluid flow within the connected fractures and is sensitive to the permeabilities as well as the lengths and intersection angles of the fractures. Correspondingly, this phenomenon contains valuable information on the governing hydraulic properties of fractured rocks and hence should be accounted for whenever realistic seismic models of such media are needed.

The initial selection was based on optical density measurements by the UV method and GC analysis. The LAB strains showed a lower ability to synthesise CLA and CLNA. Yet, two Lactobacillus sakei strains were the best producers. Moreover, the production of CLA and CLNA by Lactobacillus mucosae is reported here for the first time. In contrast, bifidobacteria strains were more efficient to synthesise CLA and CLNA. Among these, the t9, t11-CLA was the main isomer, which is a potent anticarcinogenic compound. All tested strains produced the c9, t11, c15-CLNA isomer. High substrate concentrations of LA and LNA negatively affected the conversion rate of CLA and CLNA by Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis INL2, even though the bacterial growth was not affected.

We consider vector mesons derived from different holographic dual models obtaining a general expression. We focus on the strongly coupled regime of dual gauge theories for different values of the Bjorken parameter. We find new predictions which are particularly interesting for differential scattering cross sections of polarized leptons scattered off polarized vector mesons.

Mixed spatially varying L-2-BV regularization of inverse ill-posed problems	JOURNAL OF INVERSE AND ILL-POSED PROBLEMS			English	Article						Inverse problem; ill-posed; regularization	FUNCTIONALS	Several generalizations of the traditional Tikhonov-Phillips regularization method have been proposed during the last two decades. Many of these generalizations are based upon inducing stability throughout the use of different penalizers which allow the capturing of diverse properties of the exact solution (e.g. edges, discontinuities, borders, etc.). However, in some problems in which it is known that the regularity of the exact solution is heterogeneous and/or anisotropic, it is reasonable to think that a much better option could be the simultaneous use of two or more penalizers of different nature. Such is the case, for instance, in some image restoration problems in which preservation of edges, borders or discontinuities is an important matter. In this work we present some results on the simultaneous use of penalizers of L-2 and of bounded variation (BV) type. For particular cases, existence and uniqueness results are proved. Open problems are discussed and results to signal restoration problems are presented.

We here report the effect of different additives or surface modifiers (such as cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, hexamethylenetetramine, and Triton X-100) on the synthesis of K (x) Na1-x NbO3 by a hydrothermal process. To achieve this purpose, ceramic powders are prepared using a 0.6 KOH/NaOH ratio, with a total OH- concentration of 8N under hydrothermal conditions at 200 A degrees C. Surface modifiers are used aiming to avoid agglomeration, to modify the particle surface morphology and to improve the sample density after sintering. It is worth to note that the potassium concentration in K (x) Na(1-x)NbO3 was increased by the incorporation of the surface modifiers. In this way, K (x) Na1-x NbO3-based ceramics exhibit enhanced electrical properties.	[Ramajo, L.; Castro, M.

As regard technological applications such as casting, welding and joining, these systems offer lower melting point than the pure elements, and good fluidity. The fluidity length () is known as the distance travelled by the liquid metal forced to flow through a channel of small cross section, until it is stopped by solidification. Physical variables associated with the process are: metallostatic pressure, heat extraction rate at the metal-mold interface, overheating of the liquid metal and the physico-chemical properties of the metal or alloy (latent heat of fusion, density, viscosity, surface tension and solidification mode). In general, pure metals and alloys of eutectic composition have the highest values of fluidity, whilst intermediate composition alloys with greater solidification range show lesser fluidity lengths. Taking into account that the chemical composition plays an important role in the fluidity length by its relationship with the resulting microstructure, the aim of this work is to obtain fluidity values of binary and ternary lead-free metallic alloys in order to determine the relationships between the morphology and the fluidity length, and consequently, the influence on binary and ternary pro-eutectic alloys. Fluidity tests were carried out in a linear fluidity device, using lead-free Sn based alloys, extensively used for important industrial applications. The samples were characterized using optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray micro-analysis. Usually, fluidity length () depends on solidification mode, latent heat of fusion of the alloy and the fluidity of the phases present in the microstructure.

Atomic interaction of the MEAM type for the study of intermetallics in the Al-U alloy	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article						Aluminum; Uranium; MEAM interatomic potential; Computer simulation	AB-INITIO CALCULATIONS; DIFFUSION COUPLES; THERMAL-EXPANSION; PHASE-EQUILIBRIA; ALUMINUM; URANIUM; SYSTEM; INTERDIFFUSION; STATE; POTENTIALS	Interaction for both pure Al and Al-U alloys of the MEAM type are developed. The obtained Al interatomic potential assures its compatibility with the details of the framework presently adopted. The Al-U interaction fits various properties of the Al2U, Al3U and Al4U intermetallics. The potential verifies the stability of the intermetallic structures in a temperature range compatible with that observed in the phase diagram, and also takes into account the greater stability of these structures relative to others that are competitive in energy. The intermetallics are characterized by calculating elastic and thermal properties and point defect parameters. Molecular dynamics simulations show a growth of the Al3U intermetallic in the Al/U interface in agreement with experimental evidence. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Pascuet, M.

The influence of microstructure on blistering and bubble formation by He ion irradiation in Al alloys	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							HELIUM BUBBLES; ALUMINUM; METALS; DAMAGE; MICROSCOPY; THICKNESS; STABILITY; EVOLUTION; CU	The influence of microstructure and composition on the effects of ion irradiation in Al alloys was studied combining Atomic Force Microscopy, Scanning Electron Microscopy and Transmission Electron Microscopy. For this purpose, irradiation experiments with 20 keV He+ ions at room temperature were carried out in Al, an Al-4Cu (wt%) supersaturated solid solution, and an Al-5.6Cu-0.5Si-0.5Ge (wt.%) alloy with a very high density of precipitates, and the results were compared. In Al and Ale4Cu, He bubbles were found with an average size in between 1 nm and 2 nm that was independent of fluence. The critical fluence for bubble formation was higher in Al-4Cu than in Al. He bubbles were also observed below the critical fluence after post irradiation annealing in Al-4Cu. The incoherent interfaces between the equilibrium q phase and the Al matrix were found to be favorable sites for the formation of He bubbles. Instead, no bubbles were observed in the precipitate rich Al-5.6Cu-0.5Si-0.5Ge alloy. In all alloys, blistering was observed, leading to surface erosion by exfoliation. The blistering effects were more severe in the Al-5.6Cu-0.5Si-0.5Ge alloy, and they were enhanced by increasing the fluence rate. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Soria, S.

Diffusion in thorium carbide: A first-principles study	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							FISSION-PRODUCTS; POINTS; THC	The prediction of the behavior of Th compounds under irradiation is an important issue for the upcoming Generation-IV nuclear reactors. The study of self-diffusion and hetero-diffusion is a central key to fulfill this goal. As a first approach, we obtained, by means of first-principles methods, migration and activation energies of Th and C atoms self-diffusion and diffusion of He atoms in ThC.

The gold nanowire is used as a simple model for a nanofoam, made of connected nanowires. Radiation damage by keV ions leads to the formation of a stacking fault tetrahedron (SFT), and this defect leads to a reduced plastic threshold, as expected, when the nanowire is subjected to tension. We quantify dislocation and twin density during the deformation, and find that the early activation of the SFT as a dislocation source leads to reduced dislocation densities compared to the case without radiation damage. In addition, we observed a total destruction of the SFT, as opposed to a recent simulation study where it was postulated that SFTs might act as self-generating dislocation sources. The flow stress at large deformation is also found to be slightly larger for the irradiated case, in agreement with recent experiments. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A total of 58 individuals were captured and their coloration pattern (plumage and bare parts), body linear measurements (wing chord, standard tail length, tarsus length and width, forearm length, exposed culmen length, and hallux claw length), and body mass were recorded. In addition, we banded each individual and took a blood sample from 44 individuals for molecular sex determination. In general, the body size measurements reported for A. c. cunicularia in this study agreed with previous reports based on museum specimens for the same subspecies, and were near the upper range for the species. In addition, tarsi of A. c. cunicularia were large in comparison to those of other subspecies. Sexes differed little in size, with tarsus length, tail length, and wing chord being slightly greater in males, and culmen length and mass slightly greater in females. However, mean values of these measurements did not differ statistically between sexes. The southernmost subspecies of Burrowing Owls, A. c. cunicularia, has a larger body size than the North American and Caribbean subspecies, which suggests geographical variation in body size of this species throughout its distributional range.

Entomological data were obtained from six sand fly surveys conducted in Argentina in different environments. Data analyses were conducted for the presence and the abundance of Lutzomyia longipalpis, Migonemyia migonei, and Nyssomyia whitmani (106 sites). No differences were found in presence/absence among the three types of traps for all sand fly species (p>0.05). The collection mean of Lu. longipalpis from the REDILA-BL didn ' t differ from the CDC trap means, nor were differences seen between the REDILA-WL and the CDC trap collection means (p>0.05), but collections were larger from the REDILA-BL trap compared to the REDILA-WL trap (p<0.05). For Mg. migonei and Ny. whitmani, no differences were found among the three types of traps in the number of individuals captured (p>0.05). These results suggest that both REDILA traps could be used as an alternative capture tool to the original CDC trap for surveillance of these species, and that the REDILA-BL will also allow a comparable estimation of the abundance of these flies to the CDC light trap captures. In addition, the REDILA-BL has better performance than the REDILA-WL, at least for Lu. longipalpis.

We analyzed the survival time of male and female Aedes albifasciatus (Macquart) (Diptera: Culicidae) parasitized by S. spiculatus, the time of emergence of nematodes from adult mosquitoes, and the state of parasitism in the same mosquito cohorts during the immature stages. Mosquito larvae with single and multiple parasitism (up to 11 parasites) were observed. The mortality of mosquito larvae and adults was produced in all cases where at least one mermithid emerged. The mortality of S. spiculatus showed an increasing trend in mosquito larvae with larger numbers of nematodes and was higher in larvae parasitized by eight or more nematodes. Maximum survival of parasitized adult females of Ae. albifasciatus was 38 days, while non-parasitized adult males and females survived 39 and 41 days, respectively. Strelkovimermis spiculatus mortality was observed in Ae. albifasciatus larvae with single or multiple parasitisms. The spread of mermithid parasitism in adult mosquito populations is discussed.

Climate-driven population size fluctuations of jellyfish (Chrysaora plocamia) off Peru	MARINE BIOLOGY			English	Article							HUMBOLDT CURRENT SYSTEM; SCYPHOZOAN AURELIA-LABIATA; EASTERN BERING-SEA; GULF-OF-MEXICO; EL-NINO; GELATINOUS ZOOPLANKTON; MARINE ECOSYSTEMS; REGIME SHIFTS; NORTH-SEA; ASEXUAL REPRODUCTION	There is a general concern that jellyfish populations are increasing throughout marine ecosystems worldwide, mainly due to environmental (e.g., climate drivers) and anthropogenic forces (e.g., overfishing and eutrophication), or interactions among them. To identify drivers of jellyfish populations in the heavily fished northern Humboldt upwelling system (NHUS), we examined linkages between a 43-year-long annual time series (1972-2014) of the biomass of the scyphomedusae Chrysaora plocamia and several forcing factors: the Peruvian Oscillation Index, the Regime Indicator Series and commercial landings of Peruvian anchovy. We found that C. plocamia biomass fluctuated with climate drivers, but not with anchovy landings (a proxy of fishing pressure). Jellyfish biomass was high and variable during the warm El Viejo regime in the 1970s and 1980s, with peaks connected to intra-regime El Nio Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. By contrast, no peaks occurred during warming events in the cold La Vieja regime in the late 1990s and 2000s when jellyfish biomass was very low or below detection; however, at the end of the study period, biomass rose slightly. The fishing pattern in the NHUS is just the opposite of those that previously have been attributed to removing small pelagic fish. We suggest that environmental factors and prey availability act synergistically to generate observed population size variability of this medusa in the NHUS.

Study and correlation of test parameters and limits	MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES			English	Article						Rutting performance; Wheel tracking test (WTT); BS 598-110; EN 12697-22 small size device		The wheel tracking test (WTT) is an important tool to define asphalt mixture rutting performance. In this study, the rutting behaviour in the WTT was compared under two different standards, BS 598-110 and EN 12697-22 small size device procedures. A significant number of mixtures were studied considering different volumetric characteristics, binder types and test temperatures. The relationship between calculated test parameters in both standards is discussed. Similar deformation rate responses in mixtures using both test methods were observed. A correlation between the calculated parameters rutting rate of BS 598-110 and wheel tracking slope (WTS) of EN 12697-22 was obtained. Possible WTS limits are discussed, considering previous experience in the WTT according to BS 598-110 and the relations obtained with the low shear viscosity of the binders.

The effect of 8 or 5 years of denosumab treatment in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis: results from the FREEDOM Extension study	OSTEOPOROSIS INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Bone mineral density; Clinical trial; Denosumab; Fracture; Osteoporosis; Safety	BONE-MINERAL DENSITY; ALENDRONATE; FRACTURES; TRIAL; STRENGTH; EXPOSURE; MARKERS	The FREEDOM study and its Extension provide long-term information about the effects of denosumab for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Treatment for up to 8 years was associated with persistent reduction of bone turnover, continued increases in bone mineral density, low fracture incidence, and a favorable benefit/risk profile. Introduction This study aims to report the results through year 5 of the FREEDOM Extension study, representing up to 8 years of continued denosumab treatment in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Methods Women who completed the 3-year FREEDOM study were eligible to enter the 7-year open-label FREEDOM Extension in which all participants are scheduled to receive denosumab, since placebo assignment was discontinued for ethical reasons. A total of 4550 women enrolled in the Extension (2343 long-term; 2207 cross-over). In this analysis, women in the long-term and cross-over groups received denosumab for up to 8 and 5 years, respectively. Results Throughout the Extension, sustained reduction of bone turnover markers (BTMs) was observed in both groups. In the long-term group, mean bone mineral density (BMD) continued to increase significantly at each time point measured, for cumulative 8-year gains of 18.4 and 8.3 % at the lumbar spine and total hip, respectively. In the cross-over group, mean BMD increased significantly from the Extension baseline for 5-year cumulative gains of 13.1 and 6.2 % at the lumbar spine and total hip, respectively. The yearly incidence of new vertebral and nonvertebral fractures remained low in both groups. The incidence of adverse and serious adverse events did not increase over time. Through Extension year 5, eight events of osteonecrosis of the jaw and two events of atypical femoral fracture were confirmed. Conclusions Denosumab treatment for up to 8 years was associated with persistent reductions of BTMs, continued BMD gains, low fracture incidence, and a consistent safety profile.

We analyzed data from 71 patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) with a confirmed genetic diagnosis, registered in the online Latin American Society of Primary Immunodeficiencies (LASID) database. Results. Latin American CGD patients presented with recurrent and severe infections caused by several organisms. The mean age at disease onset was 23.9 months, and the mean age at CGD diagnosis was 52.7 months. Recurrent pneumonia was the most frequent clinical condition (76.8%), followed by lymphadenopathy (59.4%), granulomata (49.3%), skin infections (42%), chronic diarrhea (41.9%), otitis (29%), sepsis (23.2%), abscesses (21.7%), recurrent urinary tract infection (20.3%), and osteomyelitis (15.9%). Adverse reactions to bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination were identified in 30% of the studied Latin American CGD cases. The genetic diagnoses of the 71 patients revealed 53 patients from 47 families with heterogeneous mutations in the CYBB gene (five novel mutations: p.W361G, p.C282X, p.W483R, p.R226X, and p.Q93X), 16 patients with the common deletion c.75_76 del.GT in exon 2 of NCF1 gene, and two patients with mutations in the CYBA gene. Conclusion. The majority of Latin American CGD patients carry a hemizygous mutation in the CYBB gene. They also presented a wide range of clinical manifestations most frequently bacterial and fungal infections of the respiratory tract, skin, and lymph nodes. Thirty percent of the Latin American CGD patients presented adverse reactions to BCG, indicating that this vaccine should be avoided in these patients. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

A Phase I Study of the Anti-Idiotype Vaccine Racotumomab in Neuroblastoma and Other Pediatric Refractory Malignancies	PEDIATRIC BLOOD & CANCER			English	Article						immunotherapy; neuroblastoma; pediatric cancer; phase I; racotumomab	CELL LUNG-CANCER; HIGH-RISK NEUROBLASTOMA; MONOCLONAL-ANTIBODY; CLINICAL-TRIAL; ALUM VACCINE; IMMUNOTHERAPY; GANGLIOSIDES; REMISSION; ACID; RETINOBLASTOMA	Background. Pediatric neuroectodermal malignancies express N-glycolylated gangliosides including N-glycolyl GM3 (NeuGcGM3) as targets for immunotherapy. Procedure. We evaluated the toxicity and maximum tolerated dose and immunological response of racotumomab, an anti-idiotype vaccine targeting NeuGcGM3 through a Phase I study enrolling children with relapsed or resistant tumors expressing NeuGcGM3. Materials and methods. Drug dose was escalated to three levels (0.15-0.25-0.4 mg) of racotumomab administered intradermally. Each drug level included three patients receiving a total of three doses, every 14 days. A confirmation cohort was added to the highest dose level. Antibody response was assessed upon study entry and at 4-week intervals for at least three immunological determinations for each patient. Results. Fourteen patients were enrolled (10 with neuroblastoma, one with retinoblastoma, one with Wilms' tumor, and two with brainstem glioma). Three patients completed the three drug levels and three were enrolled in the confirmation cohort. One patient died of tumor progression before completing the three applications. Racotumomab was well tolerated. The only side effect observed was grade 1-2 toxicity at the injection site. Racotumomab elicited an IgM and/or IgG antibody response directed against NGcGM3 in nine patients and IgM against racotumomab in 11 of 13 evaluable patients. The maximum tolerated dose was not reached and no dose-limiting toxicity was seen. Conclusions. Racotumomab vaccination has a favorable toxicity profile up to a dose of 0.4 mg, and most patients elicited an immune response. Its activity as immunotherapy for neuroectodermal malignancies will be tested in further clinical trials. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.	[Cacciavillano, Walter; Sampor, Claudia; de Davila, Maria T.

There is at present no comprehensive physical picture for all the stages of the process. We present an alternative approach with a key assumption: the vapor bubble evolves adjacent to the nanoparticle. To take into account the irreversible evolution, the statistical rate theory was used, thus avoiding the introduction of extra ad hoc parameters. Model results agree well with published data and our measurements. The only free parameter, the thermal boundary conductance, can be obtained by adjusting the model to the experimental data.

Six diets were used to feed animals during 28 days: (base (AIN93G), Chol (cholesterol 1 %, w/w), CE (alpha-tocopherol 0.005 %, w/w), CholE (cholesterol 1 % (w/w) + alpha-tocopherol 0.005 %, w/w), CAI (AI 2.5 % w/w), CholAI (cholesterol 1 % (w/w) + AI 2.5 %, w/w). Lipid profiles of plasma and liver and faecal cholesterol content were analyzed. Antioxidant status was evaluated by the ferric reducing activity of plasma (FRAP), the 2-thiobarbituric acid (TBA) assay and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in plasma and liver. Blood pressure was measured in the tail artery of rats. CholA group presented a significant (alpha < 0.05) reduction (16 %) in the plasma total cholesterol. In liver, the intake of cholesterol (Chol group) induced a significant increment in cholesterol and triglycerides (2.5 and 2.3 times, respectively), which could be decreased (18 % and 47 %, respectively) by the addition of AI (CholA group). This last group also showed an increased faecal cholesterol excretion (20 %). Increment (50 %) in FRAP values, diminution of TBA value in plasma and liver (70 % and 38 %, respectively) and diminution of SOD activity (20 %) in plasma of CholA group suggest an antioxidant effect because of the intake of AI. In addition, CA and CholA groups presented a diminution (18 %) of blood pressure after 28 days.

The new species is related to P. malmeanum, from central-western Brazil and eastern Bolivia, and Paspalum eucomum, from central Brazil. It comprises shorter plants with leaf blades and racemes shorter than those of the related species, and spikelets having obovate, deciduous upper florets. An unexpected chromosome number 2n = 12 was found in specimens of P. schesslii; thus it differs from both P. malmeanum, which has 2n = 20, and P. eucomum, for which 2n = 30 and 2n = 32 chromosome counts are here reported for the first time. The discovery of a new species having 2n = 12, which often cohabits with diploid populations of the widespread related species, P. stellatum, is consistent with an hypothesis about the hybrid origin of the polyploid cytotypes of P. stellatum having 2n = 32 and 2n = 52 chromosomes. Moreover, such an hybrid origin involving parental species with different base chromosome numbers (x = 6 and x = 10) could also explain the occurrence of 32 chromosomes in P. eucomum, potentially documenting a speciation mechanism that is otherwise unknown in the genus.

Incongruence between molecular and morphological characters in the southern king crabs Lithodes santolla and Lithodes confundens (Decapoda: Anomura)	POLAR BIOLOGY			English	Article						16S; Burdwood Bank; Centolla; COI; Lithodidae; Species delimitation	HUMAN MITOCHONDRIAL-DNA; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; MUNIDA-GREGARIA; DEEP-SEA; INTROGRESSION; POPULATION; CRUSTACEA; HYBRIDIZATION; ATLANTIC; PHYLOGEOGRAPHY	The use of genetic tools has a relevant role in fishery resource management and conservation, for example, when used in species delimitation. Morphological variation can occur as an adaptative or plastic response to environmental variation, and therefore, be mistakenly used as a criterion to delimit species. Particularly, Lithodes santolla and Lihodes confundens, two commercially important lithodid species from sub-Antarctic South America, are mainly differentiated by the number and size of spines on the carapace and pereiopods. However, variability in the size of spines of L. santolla has been reported. We evaluated whether these two morphospecies constitute reciprocally monophyletic clades at the molecular level using mitochondrial markers, and performed a detailed morphological analysis of the carapace to search for correspondence between genetic and morphological differences. The Bayesian phylogenetic reconstruction showed that L. santolla and L. confundens belong to two sister clades. However, individuals identified as L. santolla and L. confundens did not resolve as reciprocally monophyletic groups. Instead, one clade was formed by individuals belonging to both morphospecies and was widely distributed, while the other one was exclusively formed by L. santolla, and its members were only found near Puerto Montt and in the Beagle Channel. No morphological characters were found on the carapace that could differentiate individuals belonging to each genetic clade. Either if the two genetic clades constitute species or remnants of two species that are merging through introgression, they represent two evolutionary significant lineages, and measures should be taken to preserve both. Our study suggests the need to revise the use of the number of spines as a relevant taxonomic character in the taxonomy of Lithodes, and to implement molecular genetic methods to control fisheries.

The measurements were performed at different stabilized temperatures between 30 and 140 degrees C. The relaxation of the rigid amorphous fraction influences the crystallization process at crystallization temperatures higher than 70 degrees C, and the same rigid amorphous fraction constrains the development of crystals at temperatures <70 degrees C. Evidence for interlamellar segregation without influence from the crystallization temperature for DGEBA contents <30% and indications of interfibrillar or interspherulitic segregation for DGEBA contents >30% were observed. The results are discussed based on the segregation of DGEBA affecting the recrystallization process of PHB. At high temperatures, the co-existence of lamellae with different dimensions was observed. The results also indicate that DGEBA reduces the possibility of secondary crystallization in the blends.

J	Canuqueo, L				Canuqueo, Lorena			Surveyed territory, disputed territory. Notes on the implementation of the National Law 26.160 in Rio Negro, Argentina	REVISTA DE GEOGRAFIA NORTE GRANDE			Spanish	Article						Mapuche; Northern Patagonia; Argentina; territorial survey		In November 2006, the National Congress of Argentina enacted the Emergency Law of Indigenous Community Property, No. 26.160. The Law declared an emergency concerning the different forms of possession and ownership of lands traditionally occupied by indigenous communities in the country. At the same time, the Law proposes the implementation of a legal and technical land registry survey of the "traditional, public and current occupations". From the moment of implementation of the Law, there has been evidence as to the multitude of definintions and meanings that the idea of "territory" has for the actors -official agents, technicians and indigenous communities- involved in the survey process. In this paper we analyze how the implementation of Law No. 26.160 has provoked a modernization in the notion of territory and territoriality based on an update in spatial memories held by members of the mapuche community that are at the same time entangled with those perceptions produced by non-indigenous agencies.

While carbonate accumulation mechanisms have been described for many types of continental environments, especially in extensional basins, there are still uncertainties that existing facies models fail to address. The Triassic Cerro de las Cabras and Cerro Puntudo formations are alluvial-fluvial-lacustrine sequences that represent a part of the sedimentary infill of two sub-basins of the Cuyana Basin during the early stages of the Triassic rift in west-central Argentina. Previous work has provided absolute dates, confirming that these deposits are coeval (Anisian) allowing a comparative study of carbonate sedimentation in an extensional tectonic context. The description and origin of freshwater carbonate deposits and their surrounding siliciclastic sediments in specific areas of the Cuyana rift, gives insight into the major factors that control carbonate precipitation in all rift basins, including the characterization of the palaeohydrology and the importance of provenance. The Cerro de las Cabras Formation represents an ephemeral, playa-lake depositional system with subaerial exposure and pedogenesis. Its aggradational succession corresponds to the evaporative facies association lake type, diagnostic of underfilled lake basins where persistently closed surface hydrology can lead to thick evaporites. However, this formation lacks thick evaporites and has microbialitic limestones, pointing to an open groundwater supply. The Cerro Puntudo Formation represents an alkaline playa-lake system fed by groundwater and ephemeral surface-water input. The unit is an aggradational-minor progradational succession, pointing to a fluctuating profundal facies association, suggesting a balanced-filled lake type. These two synchronous, lacustrine depositional systems were influenced by tectonics and climate. Provenance and hydrology are key controls in carbonate accumulation in continental rift basins that must be included in future facies models for continental carbonates. Comparison with other rift basins suggests that application of lake-type characterizations coupled with palaeohydrology and provenance patterns will aid in developing new sedimentation models for freshwater limestones in extensional settings.

This heterogeneity complicates the sequence stratigraphic analysis of mixed systems. Outcrop studies facilitate the deciphering of controls and understanding of facies distributions within sedimentary successions. The Picun Leufu Anticline in the Neuquen Basin (Argentina) offers the opportunity to integrate large-scale depositional architecture with detailed facies descriptions of the shelf to basin successions of the Upper Jurassic - Lower Cretaceous Quintuco - Picun Leufu - Vaca Muerta System. The strata in the system are mixed and range in depositional environments from shallow marine sandstones and limestones to deep basinal shales. These environments are arranged in metre-scale shallowing upward cycles and cycle sets, with increasing carbonate proportions in regressive hemicycles. Increased input of siliciclastic material from the volcanic arc area occurred during phases of relative sea-level rise and was controlled by the intensity of along-shelf currents. The shelf transport was driven by the available accommodation space on the shelf, and therefore was a function of the eustatic sea-level fluctuations. Within the studied section, a pure carbonate depositional system developed because siliciclastic input was shut down either due to long-lived highstand settings or a sudden climatic change to more arid conditions. Carbonate-siliciclastic mixing in this setting is a function of siliciclastic dilution of the carbonate sedimentation and differs from the classical reciprocal sedimentation model, which typically includes shut-off of carbonate production during lowstand periods. In the regional context, the subsurface strata of time-equivalent reservoirs in the Eastern Neuquen Embayment display strong similarities of architecture, indicating that similar mixing processes occurred along most of the Neuquen Basin.

To assess the performance of STOP-BANG and its ability to predict sleep apnea in patients with high pre-test like-hood to present OSA referred for a home respiratory polygraphy (RP) were studied. A cross-sectional study of patients recruited over 26 months was performed. They were asked to complete the STOP-BANG questionnaire during evaluation prior to RP and were evaluated according to different apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) cut-offs. Areas under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and multiple logistic regression models were calculated. Eight hundred sixty-nine patients were studied; 557 were male (64.1 %) with a median age of 52.82 +/- 14.43 years, a body mass index (BMI) of 32.88 +/- 8.51, and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score of 7.95 +/- 5.17. The performance for AHI >= 5/h (ROC area) was: STOP 0.62, BANG 0.66, and STOP-BANG 0.69. The best sensitivity (S)-specificity (Sp) relationship for AHI >= 5/h was found with 5 components in any combination (S 56.02 %; Sp 70 %). For AHI >= 30/h, STOP was 0.68, BANG 0.66 and STOP-BANG 0.73 and the best S-Sp relationship was obtained with 5 components (S 68 %; Sp 63.6 %). Six variables (snoring, observed apneas, high blood pressure (HBP), BMI > 35, neck perimeter > 40 cm, and male gender) showed the best performance for AHI > 30/h; ROC area 0.76. STOP-BANG shows different discrimination power for AHI > 5 and >= 30/h using RP. Five components in any combination have acceptable diagnostic S to identify patients with severe OSA. STOP-BANG performed best to identify AHI >= 30/h.

We explored components from the hypothalamous-pituitary-gonadal axis and their relationship with cytokines involved in disease immunopathology, in male TB patients. Methods: Plasma samples from 36 active untreated pulmonary TB male patients were used to determine TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, TGF-beta, IL-6, cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone, testosterone, progesterone, estradiol, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) by ELISA. Healthy controls corresponded to 21 volunteers without contact with TB patients and similar age (40 +/- 16,8 years). Testicular histological samples from necropsies of patients dying from TB were immune-stained for IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IFN-gamma. The TM3 mouse Leydig cell line was incubated with recombinants TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma and TGF-beta, supernatants were collected and used to measure testosterone by ELISA. Results: Patients showed decreased levels of testosterone in presence of high amounts of LH, together with augmented IFN-gamma, IL-6 and TGF-beta levels. Testicular histological sections showed abundant presence of IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IFN-gamma in interstitial macrophages, Sertoli cells and some spermatogonia. In vitro treatment of Leydig cells with these cytokines led to a remarkable reduction of testosterone production. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Identification and evaluation of new Mycobacterium bovis antigens in the in vitro interferon gamma release assay for bovine tuberculosis diagnosis	TUBERCULOSIS			English	Article						Bovine; Tuberculosis; Diagnosis; New antigens; IGRA	INFECTED CATTLE; PARATUBERCULOSIS; COCKTAILS; SEQUENCE; IRELAND; COMPLEX; TESTS; HERD	Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) is a common zoonotic disease, caused by Mycobacterium bovis (M. bovis), responsible for significant economic losses worldwide. Its diagnosis is based on the detection of cell mediated immunity under the exposure to protein purified derivative tuberculin (PPD), a complex and poorly characterized reagent. The cross-reactivity to non-tuberculous mycobacterium species (false-positive results) has been crucial to develop a more proper antigen. In the present study, we selected six M. bovis Open Reading Frames (Mb1992, Mb2031c, Mb2319, Mb2843c, Mb2845c and Mb3212c) by insilico analysis and evaluated them in experimental and natural infection; none of these antigens had been previously assessed as diagnostic antigens for bTB. The reactivity performance was tested in animals with both positive and negative Tuberculin Skin Test (TST) results as well as in cattle infected with Mycobacterium avium subesp. paratuberculosis (MAP). The six recombinant antigens individually induced an IFN-g response, with overall responder frequency ranging from 18.3 to 31%. Mb2845c was the most valuable antigen with the potential to discriminate TST-positive cattle from either TST-negative or MAP infected animals. Mb2845c showed similar performance to that observed with ESAT-6 and PPD-B among TST and MTC specific-PCR positive animals, although this result needs to be proven in further studies with a higher sample size. Our data confirm the feacibility to implement bioinformatic screening tools and suggest Mb2845c as a potential diagnostic antigen to be tested in protein cocktails to evaluate their contribution to bTB diagnosis.

Urbanization and the temporal homogenization of bird communities: a case study in central Argentina	URBAN ECOSYSTEMS			English	Article						Bird species richness; Bird abundance; Disturbance; Morisita; Sorensen; Stability; Urbanization	EAST-CENTRAL ARGENTINA; SPECIES COMPOSITION; SEASONAL-CHANGES; LAND-USE; SIMILARITY INDEXES; COASTAL WOODLANDS; HABITAT SELECTION; URBAN GRADIENT; RURAL-AREAS; ASSEMBLAGES	Urban expansion to rural and natural areas is a global process. Although several studies have analyzed bird community attributes along urbanization gradients, little is known on the impact of urbanization on temporal variability of bird communities. Rural areas show higher seasonal and interannual variability in environmental conditions and resources than do urban areas. Our objectives are to determine how seasonal and interannual variability in bird assemblages change along an urban-rural gradient, and how interannual variability in bird assemblages changes with season. Low seasonal and interannual variability of bird communities is expected in urbanized areas that show a process of temporal homogenization. Seasonal variability of bird richness and abundance were positively related to the percent cover of crops. Seasonal and interannual variability in community composition were positively related to coverage of herbaceous vegetation and crops, and negatively related to coverage of impervious areas. Interannual variability of bird richness and abundance were highest during the non-breeding season. We conclude that highly urbanized areas allow bird communities to have a more stable composition over time, promoting temporal homogenization. Our results emphasize that urbanization alters the temporal dynamics of resources and, therefore, the temporal variability of bird communities.

For both cohorts the prevalence of each type and grade of lens opacity was determined as a function of age, from which a stochastic model was derived capable of simulating the lens opacity prevalence for both populations. These simulated lens opacity data were then converted to estimated straylight by means of an equation derived from previously recorded data of 107 eyes with varying degrees of cataract. Based on these opacity templates 2500 random sets of subject age and lens opacity data were generated by the stochastic model for each dataset, from which estimated straylight could be calculated. For the Argentinian data the estimated straylight was found to closely resemble the published models for age-related straylight increase. For younger eyes the straylight variation of the model was the same as what was previously published (in both cases 0.200 log units), which doubled in size for older eyes. For the Indonesian data, however, this age-related straylight increase was found to be fundamentally different from the published age model. This suggests that current normative curves for age-related straylight increase may not always be appropriate for non-European populations, and that the inter-individual straylight variations in young, healthy eyes may possibly be due to variations in lens opacities.

Harmful Effects of the Dermal Intake of Commercial Formulations Containing Chlorpyrifos, 2,4-D, and Glyphosate on the Common Toad Rhinella arenarum (Anura: Bufonidae)	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION			English	Article						Amphibians; Dermal exposure; Chlorpyrifos; 2,4-D; Glyphosate; Blood nondestructive parameters	GLUTATHIONE S-TRANSFERASES; BROAD-SNOUTED CAIMAN; DNA-DAMAGE; PESTICIDE EXPOSURE; OXIDATIVE STRESS; COMET ASSAY; RICE AGROECOSYSTEMS; B-ESTERASES; AMPHIBIANS; BIOMARKERS	Amphibians have complex life cycles with aquatic and terrestrial life and uncovered skins; therefore, they are exposed to chemical contamination, where dermal exposure is a significant route for pesticide uptake in both habitats. In this study, measurements in blood samples such as levels of butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), carboxylesterase (CbE), glutathione S-transferases (GST), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), modified alkaline comet assay (ACA) for detection of oxidized bases (FPG and Endo III sites), as well as the ratio of heterophils and lymphocytes (H/L), were evaluated as non-destructive biomarkers to monitor dermal pesticide exposure in male toads of Rhinella arenarum. Toads were exposed to a solution containing a nominal concentration of commercial formulations of the insecticide chlorpyrifos (CPF, 10 mg/L), and herbicides 2,4-D and glyphosate (GLY) (20 mg/L, respectively). After 48 h of exposure, the levels of plasma B-sterases (BChE and CbE) were inhibited (55 and 43 %, respectively) in toads exposed to CPF. Also, the activity of GST was inducted for dermal exposure to 2,4-D, as well as the levels of TBARS due to CPF exposure. Besides this, CPF and 2,4-D exposure induced oxidative DNA damage, and the H/L ratio decreased for the both herbicide exposures. Our results showed that exposure via dermal uptake to CPF, 2,4-D, and GLY in the common toad R. arenarum induced neurotoxicity, oxidative stress, and immunological depression. Thus, some blood biomarkers employed in our study (B-esterases, GST, levels of TBARS, ACA, and H/L ratio) might be used as predictors in health and ecological risk assessment of amphibian populations exposed to OP insecticides and herbicides.

Rotational cattle grazing is a common grazing strategy in aquatic systems but its effect on nutrient dynamics in lakes is scarcely known. The objectives of this study were to evaluate if cattle produces a significant increase of TN and TP in wetlands, and if the value of these nutrients decrease after cattle are removed. Samples of water, sediment and macrophytes were collected for nutrient, organic matter and other chemical analyses. Results showed a significant increase in water nutrients during the presence of cattle, decreasing during their absence. These changes occurred surprisingly rapid, suggesting a high resilience of these systems to this impact. The presence of submerged vegetation in lakes ameliorated the effect of cattle on water nutrients, suggesting an important role of these plants in ecosystem management. Rotational management would minimize the increase of nutrients in water, maintaining the ecological integrity of wetlands.

International multi-institutional experience with the vessel-sparing technique to reconstruct the proximal bulbar urethra: mid-term results	WORLD JOURNAL OF UROLOGY			English	Article						Vessel sparing; Excision and primary anastomosis; Urethral stricture	PRIMARY ANASTOMOSIS; URETHROPLASTY; STRICTURES; EXCISION	To present mid-term outcomes from an international, multi-institutional cohort of patients undergoing vessel-sparing excision and primary anastomosis urethroplasty for the reconstruction of the anterior urethra. From June 2003 to December 2011, 68 patients underwent vessel-sparing anterior urethral reconstruction at five different international institutions using the vessel-sparing technique described by Jordan et al. (J Urol 177(5):1799-1802, 2007). Patients' age range was from 3 to 82 years (mean 51.2). Stricture length ranged from 1 to 3 cm (mean 1.78). After a mean follow-up of 17.6 months, 95.6 % of patients had a widely patent urethral lumen. Three patients failed the procedure, requiring either direct vision internal urethrotomy or urethral dilation, after which all were free of symptoms and did not require further instrumentation. Complications were minimal and as expected following open urethroplasty. Preservation of blood supply is a noble pursuit in surgery; however, it can be technically difficult and often requires more time and effort. This vessel-sparing technique for anterior urethral reconstruction is reproducible and appears to be reliable in this international cohort.

New drugs are urgently needed for chemotherapy as those available (benznidazole and nifurtimox) have variable efficacy and elevated toxicity. Efforts are actually oriented to improve tools and technologies (e.g. transgenic parasites, flow cytometry or image-based systems) for the screening of large numbers of candidate compounds for their activity against Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi). Methods that test drug efficacy and selectivity in the same assay are suitable to accelerate the process of drug discovery. Here, we developed a GFP expressing T. cruzi from a moderate virulence stock and confirmed that the transgenic parasite retained the biological characteristics of the parental strain. With this tool, we established a flow cytometer-based method to simultaneously test drug activity against intracellular amastigotes and toxicity to the host cell. This one-step procedure allows determining the selectivity index of the tested compound in a sensitive and accurate manner even with low infection rates. This method can provide additional information on the interactions between drug, parasites and host cell and could be adapted to other typanosomatids and protozoa with intracellular multiplication.

First description of Migonemyia migonei (Franca) and Nyssomyia whitmani (Antunes & Coutinho) (Psychodidae: Phlebotominae) natural infected by Leishmania infantum in Argentina	ACTA TROPICA			English	Article						Leishmania infantum; Natural infection; Nyssomyia whitmani; Migonemyia migonei; Argentina	AMERICAN TEGUMENTARY LEISHMANIASIS; CUTANEOUS LEISHMANIASIS; VISCERAL LEISHMANIASIS; DIPTERA PSYCHODIDAE; SAND FLIES; LUTZOMYIA-LONGIPALPIS; ECO-EPIDEMIOLOGY; CLINICAL-SAMPLES; AREA; TRANSMISSION	Leishmania infantum is the etiological agent of the Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) disease in America, with Lutzomyia longipalpis phlebotomine sandflies as its proven vectors in Argentina, and infected dogs as its main urban reservoir. In Puerto Iguazu City (Misiones province, Argentina), human and canine cases of VL were recorded. Additionally, in the rural area known as "2000 Hectareas", less than 10 km away from the city, several human cases of Tegumentary Leishmaniasis (TL) were registered determining an endemic area with Leishmania braziliensis as the etiological agent. Because of this, several phlebotomine captures were done in this site showing that Nyssomyia whitmani is the most abundant sandfly followed by Migonemyia migonei. In this study, three of the sandflies captured were found infected whit L. infantum parasites, detected by PCR and sequencing. Two of them were N. whitmani and the other one was a M. migonei specimen, being this the first report off.. infantum natural infection for Argentina in these sandfly species. N. whitmani is the main vector of L. braziliensis in this area, and M. migonei has been suggested as a putative vector in other locations where human and canine cases of VL where reported with L. longipalpis apparently absent. In this context, we consider necessary further studies that could define the role of M. migonei and N. whitmani as specific or permissive vectors of L infantum, their vectorial competence and capacity, and their actual role in the transmission of both Tegumentary and Visceral Leishmaniasis in the study area.

Cystic echinococcosis therapy: Albendazole-loaded lipid nanocapsules enhance the oral bioavailability and efficacy in experimentally infected mice	ACTA TROPICA			English	Article						Lipid nanocapsules; Albendazole; Cystic echinococcosis; Echinococcus granulosus	IN-VITRO; GRANULOSUS PROTOSCOLECES; CLINICAL-EFFICACY; FLUBENDAZOLE; PACLITAXEL; DRUG; DELIVERY; PHARMACOKINETICS; FORMULATIONS; METACESTODES	Therapeutic failures attributed to medical management of cystic echinococcosis (CE) with albendazole (ABZ) have been primarily linked to the poor drug absorption rate resulting in low drug level in plasma and hydatid cysts. Lipid nanocapsules (LNCs) represent nanocarriers designed to encapsulate lipophilic drugs, such as ABZ. The goals of the current work were: (i) to characterize the plasma and cyst drug exposure after the administration of ABZ as ABZ-LNCs or ABZ suspension (ABZ-SUSP) in mice infected with Echinococcus granulosus, and ii) to compare the clinical efficacies of both ABZ formulations. Enhanced ABZ sulphoxide (ABZ-SO) concentration profiles were obtained in plasma and cysts from ABZ-LNC treated animals. ABZSO exposure (AUC(0-LOQ)) was significantly higher in plasma and cyst after the ABZ-LNC treatments, both orally and subcutaneously, compared to that observed after oral administration of ABZ-SUSP. Additionally, ABZSO concentrations measured in cysts from ABZ-LNC treated mice were 1.7-fold higher than those detected in plasma. This enhanced drug availability correlated with an increased efficacy against secondary CE in mice observed for the ABZ-LNCs, while ABZ-SUSP did not reach differences with the untreated control group. This new pharmacotechnically-based strategy could be a potential alternative to improve the treatment of human CE. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Evidence of selection on phenotypic plasticity and cost of plasticity in response to host-feeding sources in the major Chagas disease vector Triatoma infestans	ACTA TROPICA			English	Article						Cost of plasticity; Morphometric traits; Phenotypic plasticity; Selection; Triatoma infestans	REDUVIIDAE TRIATOMINAE; HEMIPTERA; ARGENTINA; POPULATIONS; PSEUDOMACULATA; BRASILIENSIS; EVOLUTION; HABITATS; PLANTS	Phenotypic plasticity is the ability of a genotype to display alternative phenotypes in different environments. Understanding how plasticity evolves and the factors that favor and constrain its evolution have attracted great interest. We investigated whether selection on phenotypic plasticity and costs of plasticity affect head and wing morphology in response to host-feeding sources in the major Chagas disease vector Triatoma infestans. Full-sib families were assigned to blood-feeding on either live pigeons or guinea pigs throughout their lives. We measured diet-induced phenotypic plasticity on wing and head size and shape; characterized selection on phenotypic plasticity for female and male fecundity rates, and evaluated costs of plasticity. Wing size and shape variables exhibited significant differences in phenotypic plasticity associated with host-feeding source in female and male bugs. Evidence of selection on phenotypic plasticity was detected in head size and shape for guinea pig-fed females. A lower female fecundity rate was detected in more plastic families for traits that showed selection on plasticity. These results provide insights into the morphological phenotypic plasticity of T. infestans, documenting fitness advantages of head size and shape for females fed on guinea pigs. This vector species showed measurable benefits of responding plastically to environmental variation rather than adopting a fixed development plan. The presence of cost of plasticity suggests constraints on the evolution of plasticity. Our study indicates that females fed on guinea pigs (and perhaps on other suitable mammalian hosts) have greater chances of evolving under selection on phenotypic plasticity subject to some constraints.

How land allocation and technology innovation affect the sustainability of agriculture in Argentina Pampas: An expanded life cycle analysis	AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						Agricultural rotations; Environmental assessment; Cash crops; Agricultural intensification	CROPPING SYSTEMS; ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; ASSESSMENT PERSPECTIVE; EMBODIED ENERGY; UNITED-STATES; INLAND PAMPA; INTENSIFICATION; CLIMATE	Pampas region grows more than 80% of Argentina's main crops, with maize (Zea maiz L.), soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.) and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) producing crop and landscape homogeneity that reduces biodiversity, agricultural system resilience and current and future regional welfare. With growing population and markets, there is a call for new agricultural patterns to meet increased food demand, together with concern for reducing environmental impact and improving social welfare. These challenges need rigorous approaches to measuring technological change costs and benefits as well as evaluating environmental impact of farmers' management practices. The objectives of this study are: [1] to evaluate resource use and environmental impact of current agricultural patterns in the northern part of Pampas region, [2] to contrast this with agricultural systems of previous decades, and [3] to analyze the incidence on space and time scales of the different proportions of land allocated to these three crops. Life cycle evaluations of cropping systems enlarge the scope of the analysis and help identify how problems might be solved. We utilize the SUMMA (SUstainability Multimethod Multiscale Assessment) framework for assessing the performance of integrated crop production in the northern Pampas in the years 1986-87, 1995-96, and 2009-10 based on actual land use data, compared to current systems with similar proportions of land distribution for the three crops, and to a wheat/soybean annual system. We also simulate other potential alternative land distribution scenarios. Results indicate a worsening of 9 to 12 out of 15 enVironmental indicators per unit of area (density of impacts), while there is an improvement per unit of product or income. The grain yield accounted in energy per hectare increased three times in relation to the year of-reference (1986), while the energy demand decreased by 32%, blue water demand increased 50%. Acidification increased more than twice (7.99 kg SO2 eq./ha), while carbon emissions (982 kg CO2 eq./ha in 2009) decreased. These results provide a benchmark for further studies where new alternatives of crop distribution may prove environmentally and economically desirable choices for farmers in the Pampas.

GLORIA-AF Investigators	Antithrombotic Treatment Patterns in Patients with Newly Diagnosed Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation: The GLORIA-AF Registry, Phase II	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF MEDICINE			English	Article						Anticoagulation; Atrial fibrillation; Registry; Stroke	PILOT GENERAL REGISTRY; EURO HEART SURVEY; STROKE PREVENTION; INTRACRANIAL HEMORRHAGE; ANTICOAGULATION CONTROL; ORAL ANTICOAGULATION; MANAGEMENT; RISK; GUIDELINES; COUNTRIES	BACKGROUND: The Global Registry on Long-Term Oral Antithrombotic Treatment in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation (GLORIA-AF) was designed to provide prospectively collected information on patients with newly diagnosed nonvalvular atrial fibrillation at risk of stroke, with the aim of addressing treatment patterns and questions of effectiveness and safety. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this predefined analysis from GLORIA-AF, the baseline characteristics and initial antithrombotic management of the first 10,000 patients in Phase II of this large Registry Program are presented. Overall, 32.3% of patients received vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) and 47.7% received non-VKA oral anticoagulants (NOACs), while 12.3% received antiplatelet treatment and 7.6% did not receive any antithrombotic treatment. Among patients with CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score <= 2, 6.7% received no antithrombotic treatment and 10.0% received aspirin. In Europe, treatment with dabigatran was as common as treatment with VKAs (38.8% and 37.8%, respectively). More than half of the patients were treated with NOACs (52.4%), while antiplatelet treatment was given to 5.7%, and 4.1% did not receive any antithrombotic treatment. In North America, treatment with dabigatran (25.0%) was as common as with VKAs (26.1%), but overall NOAC use was more common (52.1%) than with VKAs (26.1%); however, 14.1% received antiplatelet treatment, while 7.6% received no antithrombotic treatment. In Asia, treatment with VKAs (31.9%) was more prevalent than NOACs (25.5%), but antiplatelet treatment was given to 25.8%, and 16.9% did not receive any antithrombotic treatment. In Asia, only 60.7% of patients with high stroke risk received oral anticoagulants (OACs). Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and minimally symptomatic (or asymptomatic) patients were often undertreated with OACs. CONCLUSION: In this analysis, OAC use was high in Europe and North America, with overall NOAC use higher than VKA use. A considerable percentage of high-risk patients in North America still received antiplatelet treatment or were untreated, while Asian patients had a high proportion of aspirin use and nontreatment.

AtCBF1 Overexpression Confers Tolerance to High Light Conditions at Warm Temperatures in Potato Plants	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POTATO RESEARCH			English	Article						CBF1; Potato; Transgenic plants; High light; Drought; Low temperature; Gene expression profiles	ENHANCES FREEZING TOLERANCE; ABIOTIC STRESS RESPONSES; TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS; TRANSGENIC PLANTS; GENE-EXPRESSION; ARABIDOPSIS-THALIANA; SIGNAL-TRANSDUCTION; COLD-ACCLIMATION; MOLECULAR RESPONSES; SOLANUM-TUBEROSUM	We characterized transcriptional responses of potato plants to multiple abiotic stresses and used this information to identify potential mechanisms through which over-expression of the stress related transcription factor CBF1 from Arabidopsis thaliana (AtCBF1) confers multiple stress tolerance. Most transcriptional changes were specific to each condition, but genes involved in phenyl-propanoid biosynthesis were affected by all abiotic stresses evaluated. Interestingly, over-expression of AtCBF1 in potato plants not only conferred tolerance to low temperatures, as previously reported, but also to high-light conditions at 22 A degrees C, suggesting that it confers multiple stress tolerance by enhancing the ability of plants to cope with an excess of radiant energy. Finally, we found that transcriptional changes triggered by abiotic stress were much larger than those resulting from AtCBF1 over-expression in potato, revealing that overexpression of an heterologous transcription factor causes minor alterations in the plant transcriptome in comparison to transcriptional changes triggered by abiotic stresses.

Influence of pH and ionic strength on Cd, Cu and Pb removal from water by adsorption in Na-bentonite	APPLIED CLAY SCIENCE			English	Article						Clay mineral; Heavy metal; Bentonite; Adsorption; Earthen liner	PERMEABLE REACTIVE BARRIERS; HEAVY-METALS; MONTMORILLONITE SUSPENSIONS; RHEOLOGICAL PROPERTIES; LINER MATERIAL; CLAY LINER; REMEDIATION; GROUNDWATER; SORPTION; SOIL	This article presents a study on cadmium, copper and lead removal by means of adsorption in a natural Na-bentonite. Influence of pH and ionic strength on clay fabric and its role on cation removal are analyzed by means of Zeta potential and sedimentation tests. Batch adsorption and kinetics tests were carried out to quantify the adsorption capacity of the bentonite at monospecies and multispecies conditions, where ion competition was analyzed. Experimental results show that ionic strength strongly affects clay structure and cadmium removal, but has little influence on lead and copper removal. Adsorption kinetics was fast in all cases, which was mostly related to reaction kinetics than to diffusion kinetics. Cadmium adsorption can be explained by linear adsorption models, while copper, lead and the multispecies tests showed good agreement with both the linear and Freundlich models within the tested concentration range. The results confirm that tested Na-bentonite possesses a high capacity for the removal of Cd, Cu and Pb. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

(Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) and the velvet bean caterpillar Anticarsia gemmatalis Hubner (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) are key pests of soybean and other legume crops in South America. They are often found simultaneously in certain regions. A. gemmatalis nucleopolyhedrovirus (AgMNPV) is widely used to control A. gemmatalis. More recently, E. aporema granulovirus (EpapGV) has been characterized and evaluated as a bioinsecticide for E. aporema. In order to increase its potential use and to design optimized strategies for the management of lepidopteran pests, we evaluated the interaction between EpapGV and AgMNPV on third instar A. gemmatalis larvae. Larvae fed with 50 AgMNPV OBs/larva showed an increase in the mortality rates (from 42% to 81%) and a decrease in the median survival time (from 7.7 days to 5.7 days) when these OBs were mixed with 6000 EpapGV OBs/larva. When 300 AgMNPV OBs/larva were used alone or in combination with EpapGV OBs no changes in biological parameters were observed. No mortality was detected in A. gemmatalis larvae treated with EpapGV alone. In larvae fed with the viral mixtures, only AgMNPV DNA was detected by PCR. A. gemmatalis peritrophic membranes (PMs) examined by SDS-PAGE and scanning electron microscopy showed signs of damage. Notably, we found the presence of spheroidal bodies associated with damaged areas in the PMs of larvae fed with EpapGV but not in those that were given AgMNPV alone. These results show that EpapGV increases the viral potency of AgMNPV, and thus the insecticidal efficiency, suggesting that the use of formulations including both viruses might be a valuable tool for pest management.

Tree holes as larval habitats for Aedes aegypti in urban, suburban and forest habitats in a dengue affected area	BULLETIN OF ENTOMOLOGICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Culicidae; landscape; phytotelmata; population ecology; vector	SUBTROPICAL ARGENTINA; CULICIDAE; DIPTERA; MOSQUITOS; PROVINCE; EPIDEMIOLOGY; SEGREGATION; BROMELIADS; DISPERSAL; STATE	Aedes aegypti (L.) (Diptera: Culicidae), the main vector of dengue and urban yellow fever in the world, is highly adapted to the human environment. Artificial containers are the most common larval habitat for the species, but it may develop in tree holes and other phytotelmata. This study assessed whether tree holes in San Ramon de la Nueva Oran, a city located in subtropical montane moist forest where dengue outbreaks occur, are relevant as larval habitat for Ae. aegypti and if the species may be found in natural areas far from human habitations. Water holding tree holes were sampled during 3 years once a month along the rainy season using a siphon bottle, in urban and suburban sites within the city and in adjacent forested areas. Larvae and pupae were collected and the presence and volume of water in each tree hole were recorded. Finding Ae. aegypti in forested areas was an isolated event; however, the species was frequently collected from tree holes throughout the city and along the sampling period. Moreover, larvae were collected in considerably high numbers, stressing the importance of taking into account these natural cavities as potential reinfestation foci within dengue control framework.

Predation and parasitism on a citrus pest, the leafminer Phyllocnistis citrella Stainton, were evaluated by sampling over 3 years in four locations within a world leading lemon producing area in Northwest Argentina. Both mortality factors showed seasonal trends consistent across locations, with predation exerting earlier and more sustained pressure than parasitism, which showed wider seasonal variations. The dominant parasitoids, native Cirrospilus neotropicus and introduced Ageniaspis citricola, showed different seasonal trends: C. neotropicus was dominant in spring whereas A. citricola superseded it in autumn and winter. Although parasitism rates were relatively low, the native C. neotropicus revealed favourable features as potential control agent, by showing density-dependence, parasitism rates comparable with those of the specific A. citricola during part of the cycle, and earlier synchronization with the host. The study provides highly relevant information for a sustainable management of this worldwide pest, for which biological control is considered the best long-term option.

A molecular framework for the identification of planthopper vectors (Hemiptera: Delphacidae) of central Argentina	BULLETIN OF ENTOMOLOGICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						DNA barcode; molecular taxonomy; MRCV; COI; RFLP	RIO-CUARTO-VIRUS; DNA BARCODES; PCR-RFLP; GENUS; DIFFERENTIATION; CALLIPHORIDAE; POPULATION; EVOLUTION; SEQUENCES; AMERICA	Planthoppers are important worldwide crop pests as well as vectors of numerous diseases. Different species transmit Mal de Rio Cuarto virus, which causes the most economically important corn disease in central Argentina. Epidemiological studies rely on the accurate identification of the species present in the field. Presently, morphological identification of planthoppers requires taxonomic expertise and there are no taxonomic keys for females and nymphs. Nevertheless, no molecular protocols are available for accurate species identification of most frequent delphacid species from central Argentina. In this context, the aim of this study was to evaluate the utility of the cytochrome oxidase I gene (COI) as a DNA barcode and its digestion with restriction enzymes (Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism, RFLP) for the identification of the most common species of planthoppers in central Argentina. We amplified and sequenced a 843 bp fragment of the COI gene of taxonomically identified specimens and evaluated its use as a DNA barcode. Restriction enzymes were also selected for digesting the COI fragment via RFLP. The high interspecific variability (20.79%; +/- 2.32%) and low intraspecific divergence (0.12%; +/- 0.17%) observed in the studied species, demonstrate the effectiveness of the COI gene for species identification of major vector delphacids affecting corn crops in Argentina. Moreover, the digestion of this COI gene fragment with Bfa I and Apo I enzymes allows a fast and cost-effective species identification method when numerous specimens need to be processed. Both molecular techniques developed here, allow the accurate identification of planthopper species at regional scale. These new tools would assist traditional identification of these insects, especially for aiding non-experts in morphological taxonomy.	[Argueello Caro, E. B.; Dumon, A. D.; Mattio, M.

Numerous approaches use machine learning to generate such models autonomously, thus alleviating the human effort associated to this process. However, these standalone models may lack robustness, leading to a decay on the quality of information provided to workflow systems on top. This paper presents a novel approach for learning ensemble prediction models of tasks runtime. The ensemble-learning method entitled bootstrap aggregating (bagging) is used to produce robust ensembles of M5P regression trees of better predictive performance than could be achieved by standalone models. Our approach has been tested on gene expression analysis workflows. The results show that the ensemble method leads to significant prediction-error reductions when compared with learned standalone models. This is the first initiative using ensemble learning for generating performance prediction models. These promising results encourage further research in this direction.

During a critical window that lasts about two weeks, adult-born immature neurons are more excitable and plastic than mature ones, and they respond to a wider range of inputs. In apparent contradiction, new neurons have been shown to be crucial to solve behavioral tasks that involve the discrimination of very similar situations, which would instead require high input specificity. We propose that immature neurons are initially unspecific because their task is to identify novel elements inside a high dimensional input space. With maturation, they would specialize to represent details of these novel inputs, favoring discrimination.

No assessment to date has tried to estimate the potential for extra grain production for soybean, wheat and maize, which account for 78% of total harvested area, by yield gap closure on existing cropland area and its impact at a global scale. The objectives of this paper are (i) to estimate how much additional grain could be produced without expanding crop area by closing yield gaps in Argentina, (ii) to investigate how this production and yield gaps varies across regions and years, and (iii) to analyze how these inter-annual variations are related to El Nino-Southern Oscillation phenomenon (ENSO). Production increase on existing crop area was assessed for soybean, wheat and maize by quantifying the yield gap (Yg), that is, the difference between water-limited yield potential (Yw) and actual yield (Ya). A bottom-up approach was followed to estimate Yw and Yg, in which these parameters were first estimated for specific locations in major crop producing areas and subsequently up-scaled to country level based on spatial distribution of crop area and climate zones. Locally-calibrated crop simulation models were used to estimate Yw at each selected location based on long-term weather data and dominant soil types and management practices. For the analyzed period, the national level Yg represented 41% of Yw for both wheat and maize and 32% of the Yw for soybean. If farmers had closed Yg from these levels to 20% of Yw, Argentina could have increased soybean, wheat and maize production by a respective 7.4, 5.2, and 9.2 Mt, without expanding cropland area. This additional production would have represented an increase of 9%, 4%, and 9% of soybean, wheat, and maize global exports. This potential grain surplus was, however, highly variable because of the ENSO phenomenon: attainable soybean production was 12 Mt higher in favorable "El Nino" years compared with unfavorable "La Nino" years. Interestingly, Yg tended to be higher in wet years, suggesting that farmers do not take full advantage of years with favorable conditions for rainfed crop production. Regional variation in Yg was found in Argentina highlighting the usefulness of this work as a framework to target research and, ultimately, reduce gaps in areas where current yields are well below their potential.

Example criteria (size of analytical unit, sampling plan and limits) were specified for mesophilic aerobic colony count and Enterobacteriaceae as indicators of the adequacy of Good Hygienic Practices and for Salmonella as a food safety criterion. Performance characteristics were determined for each criterion using four values for standard deviation of the microbial counts to illustrate how sampling plan performance depends on the within-lot standard deviation, which is uncertain for any given lot and varies among lots. Methods of analysis were specified. A description of how to interpret the results and examples of actions that could be taken by food business operators and competent authorities are provided.

We focused on DNMT1 and DNMT3B, DNA methyltransferases responsible for (de novo) methylation, and EZH2, histone (H3K27) methyltransferase, and examined their roles in tumor suppressor gene (TSG) methylation patterns we have previously established in sporadic and familial cancers. Our investigation comprised 165 tumors, stratified by tissue of origin (117 colorectal and 48 endometrial carcinomas) and sporadic vs. familial disease (57 sporadic vs. 60 familial, mainly Lynch syndrome, colorectal carcinomas). By immunohistochemical evaluation, EZH2 protein expression was associated with a TSG methylator phenotype. DNMT1, DNMT3B, and EZH2 were expressed at significantly higher levels in tumor vs. normal tissues. DNMT1 and EZH2 expression were positively correlated and higher in microsatellite-unstable vs. microsatellite-stable tumors, whether sporadic or hereditary. Ki-67 expression mirrored the same pattern. Promoter methylation of the methyltransferase genes themselves was addressed as a possible cause behind their altered expression. While DNMT1 or EZH2 did not show differential methylation between normal and tumor tissues, DNMT3B analysis corroborated the regulatory role of a distal promoter region. Our study shows that methyltransferase expression in cancer depends on the tissue of origin, microsatellite-instability status, cellular proliferation, and-in the case of DNMT3B-promoter methylation of the respective gene. Translation of methyltransferase expression into DNA methylation appears complex as suggested by the fact that except for EZH2, no clear association between methyltransferase protein expression and TSG methylation was observed.

The electronic interface consists of a Basler ACE high-definition camera and its positioning devices and a computer with a subpixel digital image processing package. The latter includes two main procedures: one for scale calibration and the other for determining the position of crosshair lines. Both procedures work at subpixel level. The feasibility of the measurement method was verified. The resolution obtained for the measurement of angular displacements is about 0.019 s of arc, 25 times better than the one registered by the original visual system. Its overall performance was compared against an electronic level with internationally traceable certification.

Given the great potential of tissue culture techniques for plant propagation and plant genetic transformation, the competence for in vitro organogenesis from E. dunnii cotyledons and hypocotyls was assessed. Several combinations of 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP) plus alpha-naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) or indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) were added (0, 0.1, 0.5, and 1 mg l(-1)) to a specifically developed basal medium. Moreover, the effect of the hypocotyl segments position (distal and proximal) on bud and callus regeneration was studied. Finally, microcuttings obtained from in vitro multiplication of the regenerated buds were treated with different dosages of indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) or NAA (powder based) and rooted under ex vitro conditions. Bud regeneration was observed only in hypocotyl segments, where dosages of 0.5 mg l(-1) BAP plus 0.5 mg l(-1) NAA or 0.5 mg l(-1) IAA and distal segments resulted in higher bud regeneration rates. Histological analyses suggest that callus regeneration areas in hypocotyl explants recreate an appropriate niche for the development of pluripotent cells that give rise to buds and shoots. Either IBA or NAA treatments failed to significantly improved the ex vitro rooting of E. dunnii microcuttings, whereas > 50% microcuttings rooted without application of growth regulators.

Abundance of ruminal bacteria, epithelial gene expression, and systemic biomarkers of metabolism and inflammation are altered during the peripartal period in dairy cows	JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE			English	Article						gene expression; microbiome; transition cow	HIGH-GRAIN DIET; GASTROINTESTINAL-TRACT; TRANSITION PERIOD; TIGHT JUNCTION; PHYSIOLOGICAL ROLES; RUMEN FERMENTATION; INSULIN-RESISTANCE; DIGESTIVE-TRACT; MESSENGER-RNA; GROWTH-FACTOR	Seven multiparous Holstein cows with a ruminal fistula were used to investigate the changes in rumen microbiota, gene expression of the ruminal epithelium, and blood biomarkers of metabolism and inflammation during the transition period. Samples of ruminal digesta, biopsies of ruminal epithelium, and blood were obtained during -14 through 28 d in milk (DIM). A total of 35 genes associated with metabolism, transport, inflammation, and signaling were evaluated by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. Among metabolic-related genes, expression of RMGCS2 increased gradually from -14 to a peak at 28 DIM, underscoring its central role in epithelial ketogenesis. The decrease of glucose and the increase of nonesterified fatty acids and beta-hydroxybutyrate in the blood after calving confirmed the state of negative energy balance. Similarly, increases in bilirubin and decreases in albumin concentrations after calving were indicative of alterations in liver function and inflammation. Despite those systemic signs, lower postpartal expression of TLR2, TLR4, CD45, and NFKB1 indicated the absence of inflammation within the epithelium. Alternatively, these could reflect an adaptation to react against inducers of the immune system arising in the rumen (e.g., bacterial endotoxins). The downregulation of RXRA, INSR, and RPS6KB1 between -14 and 10 DIM indicated a possible increase in insulin resistance. However, the upregulation of IRS1 during the same time frame could serve to restore sensitivity to insulin of the epithelium as a way to preserve its proliferative capacity. The upregulation of TGFB1 from -14 and 10 DIM coupled with upregulation of both EGFR and EREG from 10 to 28 DIM indicated the existence of 2 waves of epithelial proliferation. However, the downregulation of TGFBR1 from 14 through 28 DIM indicated some degree of cell proliferation arrest. The downregulation of OCLN and TJP1 from -14 to 10 DIM indicated a loss of tight-junction integrity. The gradual upregulation of membrane transporters MCT1 and UTB to peak levels at 28 DIM reflected the higher intake and fermentability of the lactation diet. In addition, those changes in the diet after calving resulted in an increase of butyrate and a decrease of ruminal pH and acetate, which partly explain the increase of Anaerovibrio lipolytica, Prevotella bryantii, and Megasphaera elsdenii and the decrease of fibrolytic bacteria (Fibrobacter succinogenes, Butyrivibrio proteoclasticus). Overall, these multitier changes revealed important features associated with the transition into lactation. Alterations in ruminal epithelium gene expression could be driven by nutrient intake induced changes in microbes; microbial metabolism; and the systemic metabolic, hormonal, and immune changes. Understanding causes and mechanisms driving the interaction among ruminal bacteria and host immunometabolic responses merits further study.

We assembled a six-locus data set including nuclear, mitochondrial and low-copy protein-coding genes from 293 operational taxonomic units (OTUs). The lichenicolous lifestyle originated independently three times in lichenized ancestors within Parmeliaceae, and a new generic name is introduced for one of these fungi. In all cases, the independent origins occurred c. 24 million yr ago. Further, we show that the Paleocene, Eocene and Oligocene were key periods when diversification of major lineages within Parmeliaceae occurred, with subsequent radiations occurring primarily during the Oligocene and Miocene. Our phylogenetic hypothesis supports the independent origin of lichenicolous fungi associated with climatic shifts at the Oligocene-Miocene boundary. Moreover, diversification bursts at different times may be crucial factors driving the diversification of Parmeliaceae. Additionally, our study provides novel insight into evolutionary relationships in this large and diverse family of lichen-forming ascomycetes.

A total of 397 pairs of sagitta otoliths of A. tricolor (20 to 85 mm) were measured and analysed by means of digital images. Morphological description was done in terms of shape and features. The Huxley model was fitted to otolith length against total length (TL) and weight (TW), and residual analyses were done in order to detect the polyphasic growth. Six shape indices were calculated (otolith height/otolith length and otolith length/total length aspect ratios, rectangularity, roundness, relative sulcus surface and rostrum index) and after size effect removal, they were analysed in terms of TL. The results of these analyses allowed three distinct growth phases to be identified: (1) up to 40 mm TL and related to low swimming ability; (2) between 41 and 60-70 mm TL, when fish displacements increase but the first maturation has not yet occurred; and (3) after 71 mm TL, when fish become adults. Landmarks and semi-landmarks were used to analyse relative warps during the otolith development. The MANOVA analysis between the centroid size and class intervals showed significant differences in the interaction of all classes except between 71-80 and 81-90 mm.

When individuals are untagged, the arithmetic mean of G for a group of animals must be calculated from weight geometric means, not from arithmetic means. The type of weight mean used in articles to calculate the arithmetic mean of G is usually not reported, and an extended use of weight arithmetic means is common. The arithmetic mean of G so calculated is biased according to the increment in the squared coefficient of variation of body weights. Another potential bias in the calculation of the arithmetic mean of G is size-dependent mortality; this bias cannot be avoided when individuals are untagged, but maximal and minimal values can be obtained. In summary, in view of these analytical results, it seems prudent to calculate the arithmetic mean of G for a group of untagged animals from geometric means of weights, and to estimate the maximal error due to the possibility of size-dependent mortality whenever possible.

Peramorphic males and extreme sexual dimorphism in Monodelphis dimidiata (Didelphidae)	ZOOMORPHOLOGY			English	Article						Mouse opossum; Ontogeny; Allometry; Heterochrony; Sexual dimorphism; Geometric morphometrics	CRANIAL ONTOGENY; 1847 DIDELPHIMORPHIA; DOMESTICA; EVOLUTION; SKULL; SHAPE; HETEROCHRONY; ALBIVENTRIS; POPULATION; MARSUPIALS	The southern short-tailed opossum, Monodelphis dimidiata, is a species known not only for its semelparous life cycle, but also for the extreme sexual dimorphism of adults, where males are not only larger, but also have distinctive morphological characters in their skull. Using geometric morphometrics and a suite of statistical tests, I analyzed the postweaning ontogenetic development of this species in order to evaluate the age-class where sexual dimorphism becomes significant and the amount of change exhibited by both sexes. My results showed that M. dimidiata partly follows the ontogenetic pattern described for didelphids by previous authors. The character that escapes the general pattern is rostral length, which becomes shorter instead of lengthening throughout the development. This change could be related to an increment in the bite force in the anterior part of the dentition. The amount of sexual dimorphism found for this species is larger than the reported previously for other American marsupials, and I also found a higher rate of growth in males at the attaining of sexual maturity. Based on my results and the information available for other didelphids, I can suggest that M. dimidiata males undergo through a process of hypermorphosis, resulting in a peramorphic condition. It is possible that the extreme sexual dimorphism present in this species is related to reproductive success, specially taking into account their semelparous life cycle.

The osteoderms are articulated to form a carapace that covers their body dorsally. In this paper we study the integumentary structures of the armadillos Chaetophractus vellerosus, Chaetophractus villosus, Euphractus sexcinctus, and Zaedyus pichiy (Euphractinae), Dasypus hybridus, and Dasypus novemcinctus (Dasypodinae) within a comparative framework, aiming to identify patterns common to the family and to the subfamilies Dasypodinae and Euphractinae, as well as peculiarities of each species. Differences between the two subfamilies were observed in the dorsal integument, related to the production of blood cells and the mobility of the carapace. The Euphractinae present more numerous and larger cavities filled with adipose tissue in the osteoderms, as well as more marginal follicles than the Dasypodinae. These provide thermal insulation that could be related to their distribution in cooler climates. The sebaceous glands associated with surface follicles are also more developed in the Euphractinae and could be related to preventing the desiccation of the cornified scales in arid climates.

Future Land-Use Changes and the Potential for Novelty in Ecosystems of the United States	ECOSYSTEMS			English	Article						novel ecosystems; land-use change; global change; biodiversity; Anthropocene; scenarios	GLOBAL CHANGE; SOUTHERN WISCONSIN; FOREST COMPOSITION; SPECIES RICHNESS; PUERTO-RICO; PLANT; INVASION; CONSERVATION; MANAGEMENT; TRANSFORMATION	Rapid global changes due to changing land use, climate, and non-native species are altering environmental conditions, resulting in more novel communities with unprecedented species combinations. Understanding how future anthropogenic changes may affect novelty in ecosystems is important to advance environmental management and ecological research in the Anthropocene. The main goal of this study was to understand how alternative scenarios of future land-use change may affect novelty in ecosystems throughout the conterminous United States. We used five spatially explicit scenarios of future land-use changes, reflecting different land-use policies and changes in agricultural markets, to quantify and map potential drivers of novelty. Our results showed large areas where future land-use changes may increase novelty in ecosystems. The major land-use changes known to increase novelty, including land abandonment and land-use expansion, were widespread in all scenarios (73 million to 95 million ha), especially in the eastern U.S. and along the West Coast. Our scenarios revealed that, at broad scales, future land-use changes will increase novelty in ecosystems, and that traditional conservation policies may have limited ability to prevent the process. In places such as the eastern U.S., conserving and maintaining historical conditions and associated biological diversity may become increasingly difficult due to future land-use changes and related ecological factors.

Antagonistic and synergistic responses to solar ultraviolet radiation and increased temperature of phytoplankton from cenotes (sink holes) of the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico	FRESHWATER SCIENCE			English	Article						cenotes; global change; phytoplankton; PSII photochemistry; temperature; ultraviolet radiation	MARINE-PHYTOPLANKTON; CLIMATE-CHANGE; CHLOROPHYLL-A; UV-RADIATION; DNA-DAMAGE; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; LAKES; ARGENTINA; BLOOMS; PHOTOINHIBITION	Cenotes (sink holes) are karstic formations characteristic of the Yucatan Peninsula and are the main source of fresh water in the region. Because of their tropical location, they receive high levels of solar radiation and are exposed to high temperatures. However, the effect of these global-change-related variables on phytoplankton in cenotes is unknown. We carried out experiments with phytoplankton communities collected from 2 cenotes differing in their penetration of solar radiation (Leona Vicario [LV]: turbid, Las Mojarras [LM]: clear) to assess the combined effect of solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR; 280-400 nm) and increased temperature on their photosystem (PS) II photochemistry. We exposed samples in microcosms to solar radiation (with and without UVR) and 2 temperatures (ambient = 25 degrees C and increased by 3 degrees C) and analyzed photochemical performance over daily cycles. A significant antagonistic interaction between UVR and temperature in LV caused a combined inhibition of the effective photochemical quantum yield (Phi(PSII)) that was smaller (63%) than the sum of the 2 individual effects of UVR and temperature (116%). In contrast, a significant synergistic interaction between UVR and temperature in LM caused the combined inhibition of Phi(PSII) (172%) to be higher than the sum of the individual effects of the 2 variables (134%). Differences in the size distribution and taxonomic composition of the phytoplankton communities, with smaller cells in LV than in LM, seem to account for much of the variability in responses to UVR and increased temperature between the 2 communities. Our results suggest that phytoplankton communities from clear cenotes will be more affected by the combined effects of solar UVR and increased temperature that those from turbid cenotes.

Our goal is to present an initial conceptualization and measurement of the role think tanks play in the foreign policy sub-subsystem. We focus on three of the most influential think tanks in the region: CARI (Argentina), CEBRI (Brazil), and COMEXI (Mexico). This paper suggests that the state's characteristics and the character of its civil society determine the type and strength of its think tanks. This paper also considers the challenges that think tanks face in Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico more generally by comparing each chosen think tank's board, public activities, presence in local media and social media, and publications. We conclude that there have yet to be significant incentives and resources available for thinks tanks in Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico to grow and, thus, Latin American think tanks' activities typically follow their governments' agendas.

Recently, with the advancement of nanotechnology, the localized hyperthermia treatment of cancer has again gained interest from the scientific community. In this technique, the application of electromagnetic waves, possibly even over the surface of the patient's body, causes temperature increases in the tissues. By concentrating nanoparticles in the tumorous tissues, cell damages can be inflicted mostly to the region of interest. This paper deals with numerical simulations under uncertainties of the treatment of cancer based on hyperthermia induced by radiofrequency electromagnetic waves, where the tumor is supposed to be loaded with nanoparticles. The focus of the paper is on the solution of the inverse problem dealing with the estimation of state variables, like the temperature distribution in the tissues. The state estimation problem is solved with the Particle Filter, by utilizing the Sampling Importance Resampling (SIR) algorithm. An excellent agreement between estimated and exact temperatures is obtained, which may help medical doctors in the future to prescribe treatment protocols and also opens the possibility of devising control strategies for the hyperthermia treatment of cancer.

Natural convection in a cubical cavity filled with a fluid showing temperature-dependent viscosity	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THERMAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Natural convection; Cubical cavity; Temperature-dependent viscosity; Finite element method	LAMINAR-FREE-CONVECTION; HIGH RAYLEIGH NUMBER; BENCHMARK SOLUTIONS; NUMERICAL-SOLUTIONS; SQUARE CAVITY; ENCLOSURE; AIR; TRANSITION	We present a numerical and experimental study of laminar natural convection flow in a fluid filled cubical cavity. The fluid is a dielectric oil used for cooling distribution and power transformers. As most liquids, this oil exhibits temperature-dependent viscosity. The cubical cavity of interest has an imposed temperature difference between two opposite vertical walls while the other walls are insulated. The cavity dimensions are 0.1 m x 0.1 m x 0.1 m. Four characteristic Rayleigh numbers ranging from 1.7 x 10(8) to 6.3 x 10(8) were analyzed. The numerical study was carried out by applying the Finite Element Method to solve the 3D Navier-Stokes and heat equations using the in-house developed Par-GPFEP code. The influence of temperature-dependent viscosity on the total transferred heat and on the flow pattern, have been evaluated. Although there are several studies regarding the flow in a square cavity in this configuration, there is limited information in the literature on the 3D flow in cubical cavities with variable properties of the working fluid. We could not find in the open literature experimental measurements that we could use to validate our numerical results. For this reason an experimental setup was developed. The velocity field was visualized and measured by Particle Image Velocimetry (Ply). The temperature profiles in the vertical mid-axis at mid-plane of the cavity were measured and compared with the numerical results. We found reasonable agreement between numerical simulations and experimental measurements. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

A lithic landscape-understood as the co-occurrence, in a given geographic space, of different structural units each one composed by a raw material source and the complete set of unmodified and human-modified pieces of rock extracted from that source and then transported, used, and discarded across the landscape (i.e., a scatter area)-can be modeled using kriging, a geostatistical interpolation tool useful for integrating scattered information into coherent spatial models. The case study allows for the examination and discussion of, on one hand, the relationships between the type and location of the sources and the size and shape of the respective scatter areas and, on the other, the reciprocal relationships between different raw materials and sources. It is concluded that a proper description of the spatial structure of a lithic landscape is the needed baseline from which to evaluate different explanatory models. Such models should take into account different sets of initial conditions and generative mechanisms, in order to cope with the pervasive problem of equifinality.

In this work, apple fiber and inulin were incorporated into polysaccharide-based (alginate, pectine and gellan gum) edible coating formulations and their effects on the quality attributes of fresh-cut apples were evaluated. Antioxidant properties, color, firmness, sensory quality and microbial growth of fresh-cut apple were studied during 16 days of storage at 4 A degrees C. Results show that dietary fiber extracts incorporated to gellan gum, pectin and alginate-based coatings together with calcium chloride and ascorbic acid successfully maintained the firmness and color of coated fresh-cut apples in comparison with uncoated control samples, which presented severe texture softening and browning. The firmness of apple pieces coated with polysaccharide-based coating formulations incorporating apple fiber doubled, and sometimes tripled, that of uncoated samples. Any of the assayed coatings exhibited a positive effect on the sensory properties of fresh-cut apples. The incorporation of apple fiber, together with the use of ascorbic acid, contributed to keep the antioxidant potential of the fruit at least during the first week of storage. Furthermore, gellan gum coatings had a marked effect in reducing mesophilic and psychrophilic counts on fresh-cut apples throughout storage regardless the addition of dietary fibers. The results achieved demonstrate the feasibility of the addition of dietary fiber to edible coating formulations for increasing the nutritional value of fresh-cut apples without compromising their fresh-like quality attributes.

They were made of soy phosphatidylcholine (SPC) allowing the encapsulation of antioxidant vitamin C (VC) and tocopherol. Stearic acid (SA) or calcium stearate (CaS) was added as a bilayer stabilizer. The structural and oxidative stability of the liposomes were studied considering the heat effect of pasteurization. Size was analyzed by light scattering; shape and structure were studied by optical and transmission electron microscopy, respectively. Membrane packing was studied with merocyanine 540. Surface charge and oxidative stability were analyzed by zeta potential and ORAC method, respectively. The liposomes showed significant stability in all of the parameters mentioned above and an important protective effect over thermolabile VC. To confirm their applicability in food, the rheological behavior and a sensory evaluation of liposomes with vitamin C and bioactive constituents were studied. The sensory evaluation of liposomes in orange juice was performed by the overall acceptability and triangular tests with 40 and 78 potential consumers, respectively. The incorporation of all liposomal formulation did not change the acceptability of orange juice. Noteworthy, SPC and SPC:SA systems had rheological behavior similar to a Newtonian fluid whereas that SPC:CaS presented a pseudoplastic one, both considered excellent for larger scale production. From all the obtained results, we can conclude that these liposomal formulations are suitable for food industry applications, incorporating bioactive constituents and generating functional orange juice that conserves its bioactivity after pasteurization.

Loss of lipid material during the dehulling of oilseeds with different structural characteristics	JOURNAL OF FOOD SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-MYSORE			English	Article						Sunflower; Safflower; Dehulling; Loss of lipid material	SUNFLOWER SEED; OIL; PERFORMANCE; SYSTEM	The loss of lipid material by migration to the hull during the dehulling of oilseeds with different structural characteristics was evaluated. The samples selected -three sunflower hybrids and a safflower cultivar- were processed under optimal dehulling operating conditions and with two passes through a dehuller. From the SEM micrographs of the samples it was possible to observe structural differences which affect the mechanical properties of the pericarps and, consequently, the dehulling process. The black-hull sunflower hybrid exhibited residual hull percentages lightly above those recommended by the industry after one pass through the dehuller, therefore, this hybrid should not be further processed to avoid oil losses due to migration to the hull. On the other hand, the safflower cultivar and the high stearic high oleic sunflower hybrid and the traditional striped-hull sunflower require two passes through the dehuller, but this resulted in an oil loss due to migration to the hull of over 0.9 % per gram of grains processed.

Effect of ball milling energy on rheological and thermal properties of amaranth flour	JOURNAL OF FOOD SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-MYSORE			English	Article						Ball milling; Amaranth; Pseudoplastic behavior; Viscosity	DAMAGED STARCH GRANULES; CASSAVA STARCH; PHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES; SWELLING PROPERTIES; RICE FLOUR; MAIZE; FRACTIONS; PASTES; WATER	Pearled amaranth grains obtained by abrasive milling were processed by planetary ball milling to produce amaranth flours. The influence of milling energy on rheological and thermal behavior of amaranth flour dispersions and stability during 24 h storage at 4 A degrees C were investigated based on a factorial design. The rheological behavior of flour dispersions (4 % and 8 % w/v) was determined using a rotational viscometer, while gelatinization degree was determined by differential scanning calorimetry as a measure of structural changes.The power law model was found to be suitable in expressing the relationship between shear stress and shear rate. Flour dispersions showed a pseudoplastic behavior. However this character decreased with the storage being dependent on flour concentration and milling energy. A decrease of the consistency index and an increase of the flow behavior index were observed as a result of the increasing milling energy. Gelatinization enthalpy decrease showed the loss of crystalline structure due to ball milling. Amaranth flour dispersions presented increasing stability during storage. It was observed, that the stability changed with the concentration of amaranth flours.Thus, more stable dispersions were obtained as the flour concentration increased. The highly milled sample was the most stable sample during the storage.

Structure of the Tortricid-Parasitoid Community in a Recently Introduced Crop	NEOTROPICAL ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						Argyrotaenia sphaleropa; blueberry food web; parasitoid guilds; Vaccinium corymbosum	FOOD WEBS; LEPIDOPTERA-TORTRICIDAE; DIVERSITY; ARGENTINA; CONNECTANCE; BLUEBERRIES; HYMENOPTERA; INSECTS; GUILDS; HOSTS	The introduction of exotic commercial plants represents a change in the food resources for the communities of herbivores. The blueberry is native to the northern hemisphere and was recently introduced in Argentina, so we expect to find polyphagous tortricids and a low complexity in the tortricid-parasitoid community. Tortricids are exophytic leaf-rollers and flower and fruit feeders, they can feed on different plant structures, and they may be present in every blueberry phenological stage. The aims of this study were (a) to estimate the relative abundance of tortricids in different plant structures and phenological stages of blueberry, (b) to evaluate the relative importance of the different parasitoid guilds, and (c) to describe the tortricid-parasitoid community in blueberry fields of Argentina. The abundance of tortricids in blueberries was low and mainly localized to flowers and fruits. Five parasitoid guilds were identified: early larval endoparasitoids (Apanteles sp. and Dolichogenidea m1 and m2), larval-prepupal endoparasitoids (Austroearinus sp.), larval-pupal endoparasitoids (Ichneumonidae), larval ectoparasitoids (Eulophidae), and pupal endoparasitoids (Brachymeria sp. and Conura sp.). Most parasitoids were koinobiont larval endoparasitoids. The tortricid-parasitoid food web was very simple in comparison to those of other systems, with high values of vulnerability and connectance. The results of this study suggest that the abundance of tortricids in blueberry crop in Argentina is low. From the point of view of production, the risk of economic losses and the likelihood of direct damage to the fruit would be very low.	[Rocca, M.; Greco, N.

Holocene paleoagrostological impressions from the Eastern Chaco Region (Argentina)	REVIEW OF PALAEOBOTANY AND PALYNOLOGY			English	Review						Chaco; Quaternary; Poaceae; Spikelet impressions	BERMEJO RIVER FORMOSA; ENTRE-RIOS; MESOPOTAMIAN REGION; ITUZAINGO FORMATION; LATE PLEISTOCENE; SOUTH-AMERICA; RECORD; SYSTEMATICS; QUATERNARY; CARNIVORA	The Chaco region is a sedimentary basin limited by the Andes and the Brazilian craton. This South American subtropical plain is defined as large alluvial fan sediments of the main rivers that were repeatedly deposited during the late Quaternary under diverse climatic conditions. The Eastern Chaco is characterized by semideciduous forests intermingled with extensive palm-savannas, with gallery forests being the common vegetation along the banks of the main rivers and their western tributaries. These vegetation patterns of the Chaco have been proposed to be the result of the Pleistocene-Holocene alluvial dynamics of the plain as well as of the intensive migration of fluvial belts of the main rivers. Although no data are available on the paleoflora of the Chaco plain, plant fossil impressions are found in the banks of the low Bermejo River, which flows along the Eastern Chaco phytogeographic region. Here, we analyze paleoagrostological impressions recovered from two fossiliferous localities in order to provide insights into the environmental history of the Chaco region. Sixty complete Poaceae spikelet impressions were studied morphologically and compared with extant Chaco grass species. For each fossil spikelet, 11 morphological characters were described and statistically analyzed. All spikelets were found to belong to the Panicoideae subfamily, and some have consistent morphological features with this subfamily; hence, we assign them to the extant genera Cenchrus, Echinochloa, Hymenachne, and Paspalum. These impressions are the first floral remains found in the Eastern Chaco and collectively suggest that environmental and climatic conditions from these sediments corresponded to a subtropical humid climate and that vegetation was similar to the extant Eastern Chaco flora.

Updated site compilation of the Latin American Pollen Database	REVIEW OF PALAEOBOTANY AND PALYNOLOGY			English	Article						Pollen analysis; Latin America; Site distribution patterns; Age control density; Publication history; LAPD	LATE-QUATERNARY VEGETATION; LAST GLACIAL MAXIMUM; FOREST-SAVANNA DYNAMICS; LAGUNA POTROK AIKE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RAIN-FOREST; BIOME RECONSTRUCTIONS; SOUTHERN PATAGONIA; FOSSIL POLLEN; PALYNOLOGICAL EVIDENCE	The updated inventory of the Latin American Pollen Database (LAPD) offers a wide range of new insights. This paper presents a systematic compilation of palynological research in Latin America. A comprehensive inventory of publications in peer-reviewed and grey literature shows a major expansion of studies over the last decades. The inventory includes 1379 cores and sections with paleoecological data and more than 4800 modern samples from throughout the continent. Through the years, pollen datasets extend over increasing spans of time and show improved taxonomic and temporal resolution. Currently, these datasets are from 12 modem biomes and 30 countries, covering an altitudinal range of 0 to 6300 m asl. The most densely sampled regions are the Colombian Andes, the southeast coast of Brazil, and Patagonia. Underrepresented biomes are the warm temperate mixed forest (3%), dry forests (3%), and warm temperate rainforest (1%); whereas steppe, tropical rainforest, and cool grass shrublands, such as the paramos, are generally well represented (all >17%). There are 126 records that span the late Pleistocene to the Last Glacial Maximum transition (21,000 cal yr BP), and >20% of the records cover the Younger Dryas interval and the Pleistocene/Holocene transition. Reanalysis of numerous sites using multiproxy tools emphasize the informative value of this approach in paleoenvironmental reconstruction. We make suggestions for several pollen sites and regions to be visited again; similarly we identify some key research questions that have yet to be answered. The updated LAPD now provides the platform to support an exciting new phase of global palynological research in which multi-site data are being integrated to address current cutting-edge research questions. The LAPD compilation of sites and the literature database will be available through the Neotoma Paleoecology Database website and a new LAPD website by the end of 2015. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Chemical activation in Rhinella arenarum oocytes: effect of dehydroleucodine (DhL) and its hydrogenated derivative (2H-DhL)	ZYGOTE			English	Article						Calcium; Dehydroleucodine; Oocyte activation; Rhinella arenarum	INOSITOL 1,4,5-TRISPHOSPHATE; SESQUITERPENE LACTONES; MEIOSIS REINITIATION; RYANODINE RECEPTORS; STARFISH OOCYTES; MATURATION; FERTILIZATION; RELEASE; CALCIUM; PATHWAY	Mature oocytes are arrested in metaphase II due to the presence of high levels of active maturation promoting factor (MPF). After fertilization, active MPF levels decline abruptly, enabling oocytes to complete meiosis II. One of the first and universal events of oocyte activation is an increase in cytosolic Ca2+ that would be responsible for MPF inactivation. Mature oocytes can also be activated by parthenogenetic activation. The aims of this work are to test the ability of dehydroleucodine (DhL) and its hydrogenated derivative 11,13-dihydro-dehydroleucodine (2H-DhL) to induce chemical activation in amphibian oocytes and to study the participation of calcium in the process. Results indicated that DhL and 2H-DhL induced oocyte activation in a dose-dependent manner. After 90 min of treatment, DhL 36 M was able to induce 95% activation, while 2H-DhL 36 M was less active, with only 40% activation. Our results suggest that DhL induced the inhibition of MPF activity, probably by an increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration. Extracellular Ca2+ would not be significant, although Ca2+ release from intracellular stores is critical. In this sense, IP(3)Rs and RyRs were involved in the Ca2+ transient induced by lactones. In this species, RyRs appears to be the largest contributor to Ca2+ release in DhL-induced activation. Although more studies are needed on the mechanism of action through which these lactones induce oocyte activation in Rhinella arenarum, the results of this research provide interesting perspectives for the use of these lactones as chemical activators in in vitro fertilization and cloning.

Their affinity with the floral composition of each site and a possible influence of local atmospheric conditions on total fungal spore richness were tested. This analysis allowed the recognition of 82 fungal morphotypes as a whole. The cluster analysis (Jaccard index) showed that EP1 and EP3 are similar communities and separated from the EP2 community (with a similarity index < 52 %). The principal component analysis showed a positive correlation between the affinities of fungi substrates preferences and the floral physiognomy and composition in EP1 and EP3, whereas the EP2 area revealed a community of fungal taxa typical of grassland environments. Three peaks of species richness per year were registered: (1) from January to April (summer to beginning of autumn), (2) in July (winter) and (3) from October to November (spring) each year. In this exploratory research these peaks are related to warmer and rainy conditions during summer and spring and of maximum accumulation of organic matter during the winter. In summary, aeromycoflora communities could be used as ecological proxies to infer the main floral composition of a study site and as indicative of the climate regime of the area.

Due to their ability to regulate lipid metabolism and cholesterol transport, they have become attractive pharmacological targets. LXRs are closely related to DAF-12, a nuclear receptor involved in nematode lifespan and regulated by the binding of C-27 steroidal acids. Based on our recent finding that the lack of the C-25 methyl group does not abolish their DAF-12 activity, we evaluated the effect of removing it from the (25R)-cholestenoic acid, a LXR agonist. Methods: The binding mode and the molecular basis of action of 27-nor-5-cholestenoic acid were evaluated using molecular dynamics simulations. The biological activity was investigated using reporter gene expression assays and determining the expression levels of endogenous target genes. The in vitro MARCoNI assay was used to analyze the interaction with cofactors. Results: 27-Nor-5-cholestenoic acid behaves as an inverse agonist. This correlates with the capacity of the complex to better bind corepressors rather than coactivators. The C-25 methyl moiety would be necessary for the maintenance of a torsioned conformation of the steroid side chain that stabilizes an active LXR beta state. Conclusion: We found that a 27-nor analog is able to act as a LXR ligand. Interestingly, this minimal structural change on the steroid triggered a drastic change in the LXR response. General significance: Results contribute to improve our understanding on the molecular basis of LXR beta mechanisms of action and provide a new scaffold in the quest for selective LXR modulators.

An abietane diterpene from Salvia cuspidata and some new derivatives are active against Trypanosoma cruzi	BIOORGANIC & MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS			English	Article						Natural products; Diterpenes; Trypanosoma cruzi; Salvia cuspidata	SESQUITERPENE LACTONES; ANTILEISHMANIAL ACTIVITY; CULTURED EPIMASTIGOTES; CHAGAS-DISEASE; 5-EPI-ICETEXONE; MEDICINES; ICETEXANE; GILLIESSI	The Plant Kingdom is an excellent source for obtaining natural compounds with antiprotozoal activity. In the present work, we studied the effect of the diterpene 12-hydroxy-11,14-diketo-6,8,12-abietatrien-19,20-olide (HABTO) obtained from the aerial parts of Salvia cuspidata on Trypanosoma cruzi epimastigotes. This compound was found to inhibit parasite growth even at low concentrations (IC50 5 mu g/mL) and with low toxicity on mammalian cells. In addition, this diterpene induced an intense vacuolization within the parasites. In order to obtain analogs with greater lipophilicity, chemical modifications on the enol moiety were carried out to obtain the acetyl (AABTO), the sylil (SABTO) and the allyl (ALLABTO) derivatives. We observed that the SABTO was the most effective one on the parasites, and the effect could be attributed to a greater lipophilicity of this compound. Taking into account these data we conclude that the increase of lipophilicity by chemical modifications is an adequate strategy for improving the trypanocidal activity of this kind abietane diterpenes.

Modification of pharmacological treatment was decided on the basis of pre-established criteria; therefore, the number of therapeutic changes between both techniques was compared.ResultsA total of 200 patients were included. The average daytime ABPM systolic blood pressure (SBP) was 13616 compared with 136 +/- 15 (P=1) with HBPM; the average diurnal diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was 83 +/- 12 and 81 +/- 9, respectively (P=0.06). The concordance between both methods was very good for SBP [r=0.85; Bland-Altman 0.2 (95% confidence interval 0.9-1.4mmHg)], and good for the DBP [r=0.77; Bland-Altman 1.8 (95% confidence interval 0.8-2.8mmHg)]. Both methods were in agreement that HTN was controlled in 68 patients and that it was not controlled in 90 patients, that is, they were concordant in 158 patients (79%, =0.6). More patients required changes with ABPM than HBPM (149 vs. 99 patients, P<0.0001)ConclusionThere were no significant differences in the measurement of diurnal SBP and DBP between both methods. The concordance to determine proper control of HTN was 79%. There was a significant difference in the decision to modify the treatment in favor of the ABPM.

Key approach-based transitions	Current Opinion in Supportive and Palliative Care			English	Review						ALS/MND; end of life; end stage; neuromuscular diseases; palliative approach	AMYOTROPHIC-LATERAL-SCLEROSIS; NONINVASIVE VENTILATION; RESPIRATORY CARE; PALLIATIVE CARE; AIDS; LIFE	Purpose of review To revise the definition of end stage in the setting of neuromuscular disease (NMD), to understand the implications for the patient, family and healthcare team, and to address the obstacles involved in the lack of definition. Recent findings Unlike several conditions such as cancer, kidney or liver disease, the literature reveals no clear definition or categorization for NMD. Many articles mention end stage without defining it. Many years ago an expert consensus panel defined it based on functional criteria (forced vital capacity values and hypercapnic events). Only for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motoneurone disease has a wider criteria been proposed. As a consequence, the management of this heterogeneous group of disorders is often fragmented compared with the well organized palliative care program for cancer patients. Summary Better end-stage NMD definitions should help to identify the goals of care, but a broad range in time and intensity of deterioration make a valid definition difficult for end-stage NMD. Respiratory care, life-prolonging therapies, and structured care planning should be seen as complementary rather than dichotomous. This article emphasized the relevance of an integrated approach through the whole trajectories of NMD patients considering key transitions.

In this work, we studied the genetic structure of the capybara throughout part of its geographic range in Argentina using a DNA fragment of the mitochondrial control region. Haplotypes obtained were compared with those available for populations from Paraguay and Venezuela. We found 22 haplotypes in 303 individuals. Hierarchical AMOVAs were performed to evaluate the role of river drainages in shaping the genetic structure of capybara populations at the regional and basin scales. In addition, two landscape genetic models, isolation by distance and isolation by resistance, were used to test whether genetic distance was associated with Euclidean distance (i.e. isolation by distance) or river corridor distance (i.e. isolation by resistance) at the basin scale. At the regional scale, the results of the AMOVA grouping populations by mayor river basins showed significant differences between them. At the basin scale, we also found significant differences between sub-basins in Paraguay, together with a significant correlation between genetic and river corridor distance. For Argentina and Venezuela, results were not significant. These results suggest that in Paraguay, the current genetic structure of capybaras is associated with the lack of dispersion corridors through permanent rivers. In contrast, limited structuring in Argentina and Venezuela is likely the result of periodic flooding facilitating dispersion.

The aim of this article is first to describe the social, political, and economic processes that explain the emergence of UNASUR and its focus on social policy through healthcare. We then analyze how by virtue of UNASUR's Health Council, healthcare became the spearhead of cooperation giving way to novel forms of diplomacy. In so doing, this article contributes to a broader understanding of the regional health diplomacy and the process of unasurization of health policies as the process of building a new health framework.

It is mainly distributed in Argentina from 30 degrees latitude south in the northwestern region of the country, to 52 degrees south in Patagonia, from 63 degrees longitude in coastal areas to 73 degrees along the Andean Cordillera, across multiple habitats and including a small area in Chile. Several morphological and molecular taxonomic studies on a subset of these species have been published, but no comprehensive phylogenetic hypothesis is available for the clade. The objective of this work is to present a molecular phylogenetic hypothesis for the majority of the described species in the clade. We sequenced two mitochondrial genes, five nuclear protein coding, and three anonymous nuclear loci, and implemented traditional concatenated analyses as well as a species-tree approach. All methods inferred very similar topologies. We found the genera Diplolaemus and Leiosaurus to be monophyletic, whereas P. torquatus was retrieved as a separate lineage from the other Pristidactylus species with strong statistical support. Within Diplolaemus, D. darwinii is a very distinct lineage with an estimated divergence time of similar to 14.74 million yr ago (mya). Based on an early Miocene Leiosaurae fossil mandible, we estimated the crown common ancestor of the genus Leiosaurus at similar to 9.24 mya, and L. bellii is the earliest divergent lineage within this genus. The Argentinean Pristidactylus species seem to have radiated relatively recently (4.02 mya). A combination of geological and climatic events during Middle and Late Miocene, and climatic changes associated with glaciations, most probably played a role in the divergence of the Leiosaurae clade. The diversification patterns of Diplolaemus and Leiosaurus seem to have followed a general south-to-north direction, while the Argentinean Pristidactylus may have diversified east-to-west and north-to-south. We suggest that morphological and thermo-physiological studies combined with palaeo-niche modeling analyses are needed to test these hypotheses and better understand the biogeographical history of this clade.

The sunflower transcription factor HaWRKY76 confers drought and flood tolerance to Arabidopsis thaliana plants without yield penalty	PLANT CELL REPORTS			English	Article						Transcription factor; WRKY; Drought; Submergence; Sunflower; Arabidopsis	OSMOTIC-STRESS TOLERANCE; END RULE PATHWAY; GENE-EXPRESSION; TRANSGENIC ARABIDOPSIS; SUBMERGENCE TOLERANCE; SALT STRESS; RICE; WATER; OVEREXPRESSION; ASTERACEAE	Water deficit and water excess are abiotic stress factors that seriously affect crops worldwide. To increase the tolerance to such stresses without causing yield penalty constitutes a major goal for biotechnologists. In this survey, we report that HaWRKY76, a divergent sunflower WRKY transcription factor, is able to confer both dehydration and submergence tolerance to Arabidopsis transgenic plants without yield penalty. The expression pattern of HaWRKY76 was analyzed in plants grown in standard conditions and under different watering regimes indicating a regulation by water availability. The corresponding cDNA was isolated and cloned under the control of a constitutive promoter and Arabidopsis plants were transformed with this construct. These transgenic plants presented higher biomass, seed production and sucrose content than controls in standard growth conditions. Moreover, they exhibited tolerance to mild drought or flood (complete submergence/waterlogging) stresses as well as the same or increased yield, depending on the stress severity and plant developmental stage, compared with controls. Drought tolerance occurred via an ABA-independent mechanism and induction of stomatal closure. Submergence tolerance can be explained by the carbohydrate (sucrose and starch) preservation achieved through the repression of fermentation pathways. Higher cell membrane stability and chlorenchyma maintenance could be the nexus between tolerance responses in front of both stresses. Altogether, the obtained results indicated that HaWRKY76 can be a potential biotechnological tool to improve crops yield as well as drought and flood tolerances.

By using spray drying, phytosterols microparticles were formulated and developed in this work. Arabic gum, maltodextrin and one of two different surfactants were thoroughly studied as wall materials. Increasing concentrations ofTween 20 (T20) or sodium lauryl sulfate (SDS), from 0.1 to 2.65% w/v, were evaluated. The feed suspension characteristics (viscosity, interfacial properties and particle size distribution), process yield (PY), encapsulation efficiency (EE), phytosterols retention (R) and size of the microparticles were analyzed. The presence of surfactants in the suspension to be spray dried has significant effects on the studied responses. 120 led to process yields around 65% (2% w/v surfactant concentration). On the other hand, the microparticles obtained using 2% w/v Of SDS were the best in terms of EE (about 50%), R (close to 40%) and particle size (5.89 mu m), being the PY acceptable (almost 55%).

Both the local structural and the magnetic properties are investigated using X-ray diffraction, XAFS and magnetic measurements. The evolution of these properties with milling time, atomic content and milling atmosphere is analyzed. XAFS measurements revealed the progressive incorporation of doped atoms into the ZnO wurtzite crystalline structure. Also, the oxidation states of 2(+) and 3(+) for Fe atoms and 2(+) for Co ones are confirmed. Furthermore, the presence of oxygen vacancies is predicted by EDAX and XAFS. These results, in combination with previous ones, will contribute to the comprehension of the controversial ferromagnetic behavior in these diluted semiconductor materials.

The purpose of this work is to study the impact of seed size, bed temperature, binder flowrate, and fluidization and atomization air flowrates on process parameters, such as mass balance closure, fines deposited on granulator walls and granulation efficiency, and on product properties, such as particle size distribution, percentages of particles effectively coated or agglomerated and granule crushing strength, among others. This is done to find the operating regions capable of avoiding lump formation or out-of-specification granule production. This work is focused on operating conditions and seed diameter ranges not addressed before. In particular, relatively large seed particles compared to the size of the droplets, high binder/seed mass ratios, and bottom spray are used. The specific method proposed to characterize the granular product into three categories (fines, pure coated particles, and agglomerated/coated granules), allowed to identify the main growth mechanisms for an extended range of operating conditions and seed sizes. The agglomeration rate was found to increase by decreasing the fluidization and atomization air flowrates and the bed temperature, as well as by increasing the binder flowrate. The agglomerated mass fraction presented a non-monotonic behavior as a function of the seed diameter, with a minimum at a seed mean diameter of about 0.26 cm. Even though the operating variables were widely disturbed, the main particle growth mechanism was pure coating for all the tested conditions. In fact, coated particles accounted for more than 68 wt.% of the granular product. As a result, the final mass median size remained almost constant for all the studied cases. On the other hand, the span of the particle size distribution was extremely sensitive to the selected operating conditions. This contribution provides some valuable guidelines to avoid agglomeration in melt granulation processes designed to produce coated granules. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This answers an open question of N. Andruskiewitsch. In the course of our proof we establish analogues of the Noether isomorphism theorems of group theory for arbitrary Hopf algebras under certain faithful (co)flatness assumptions. As an application, we prove an analogue of Zassenhaus' butterfly lemma for finite dimensional Hopf algebras. We then use these results to show that a Jordan-Holder theorem holds as well for lower and upper composition series, even though the factors of such series may not be simple as Hopf algebras.

We extend innovation studies and enrich the export literature by analyzing the role of firms' innovation and market strategies in explaining export diversification. To do so, we use a unique dataset that links data on exports, innovation and firms' characteristics at the firm level in Brazil. Our findings show that access to existing resources, as emphasized by existing innovation studies on emerging economies, cannot account for all the heterogeneity observed in firm's export diversification in Brazil. Innovative efforts and the strategic positioning of firms in the domestic market are crucially important in explaining diversification. These results emphasize the importance of distinguishing new from existing exports when investigating the dimensions that affect export performance. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This paper develops an eclectic model that has the potential to nest demand-side elements, but focuses on cost-push factors distributional conflict and propagation mechanisms as typically addressed by the post-Keynesian structuralist tradition. In addition to shedding some light on the nature of inflationary pressures as experienced in Latin American countries during the recent commodity boom in particular South American commodity exporting economies the paper's main goal is to portray the policy and instrumental trade-offs faced by policy-makers themselves. By bringing unconventional policy devices into the model (such as direct interventions in commodity markets), we hope to broaden the scope of the conventional macroeconomic policy instruments.

J	Banerjee, O; Cicowiez, M; Gachot, S				Banerjee, Onil; Cicowiez, Martin; Gachot, Sebastien			A quantitative framework for assessing public investment in tourism - An application to Haiti	TOURISM MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Tourism investment; Economy-wide modeling; Computable general equilibrium; Haiti; Microsimulation; Pro-poor tourism investment; Poverty; Impact assessment; Cost-benefit analysis		This study develops a linked regional computable general equilibrium and micro-simulation (RCGE-MS) model to assess the regional economy-wide and poverty impacts of a US$36 million investment in tourism in the south of Haiti. The first social accounting matrix for Haiti with a base year of 2012/2013 was constructed to calibrate the model. This research addresses three key gaps identified in the tourism impact assessment literature. First, a destination-specific tourism demand and value chain analysis was used to calibrate the shocks implemented in the model. Second, the RCGE-MS approach moves beyond the representative household configuration to enable more robust analysis of tourism investment impacts on poverty and income inequality. Third, results of this modeling were used to inform a social cost-benefit analysis to provide greater transparency in the evaluation of trade-offs between investment alternatives. Results of this analysis showed a positive impact on sectoral activity, especially for the hotel and restaurant sector (182.1% in 2040) and a 2.0% increase in Gross Regional Product by 2040. The South's exports fell 4.7% below baseline and imports were 6.1% higher due to the inflow of foreign exchange, the appreciation of the regional real exchange rate, increased demand for most goods and services, and limited regional productive capacity. The rate of unemployment fell from 26% to 23%. The investment helped lift some of the region's poorest out of poverty, reducing the poverty headcount by 1.6 percentage points. Driving this result was an increase in employment, wages and non-labor income. The linked RCGE-MS approach proves to be a powerful tool for assessing how tourism investments affect regional economic activity and revealing the mechanisms through which tourism can contribute to increased employment opportunities and poverty reduction.

The results of this analysis support the idea that the function of positive emotion must be always understood in context; besides, there is an optimal point from which positive emotions could generate disadvantageous results. This optimal moment would be closely linked to the process of affective regulation. Too intense and permanent positive emotions would generate counter-productive effects on psychosocial well-being. Examining the 'limits' of positive emotions allows a more complete picture of their benefits enabling a more critical and accurate approach to the issue.

This view reassesses the inherited conceptions of the teaching of architecture by proposing an interpretation of the process as knowledge-generating praxis. Specifically, the study focused on the different types of knowledge involved in the project, both explicit-conceptual and implicit-procedural. The strategies used made it possible to triangulate a theoretical analysis with a descriptive-observational research design in order to study project protocols (components) and their curricular design approaches. The data revealed complex cognitive and representational activities in the design process, although they are not normally regarded as objects of study in classical models of educational management. A praxeological model of variables is proposed to understand how projects function, as well as several guidelines to bring about change in educational activities.

While these approaches are useful in the natural sciences, it is doubtful that they are similarly applicable in the socioeconomic realm. In this paper it is expected to show that the logic of socioeconomic processes of being "possibility trees" or "open-ended results" makes regularities the exception rather than the rule. Alternatively, a mode of explanation that focuses on contextual factors and people actions is proposed.

J	Martinez, A				Martinez, Ariel			THE TENSION BETWEEN MATERIALITY AND DISCOURSE: JUDITH BUTLER'S NOTION OF BODY	CINTA DE MOEBIO			Spanish	Article						Judith Butler; body; discourse; materiality; sex		This article proposes to analyse the way in which the body is addressed in the philosophical works of Judith Butler. The constructionism that characterizes her initial articles has been widely spread in the contemporary debates about sex and gender diversity, since in those articles she links the body to a discursive ontology that denounces the contingent and unnecessary welding between body - which is considered as the substantial and natural basis of gender and sexuality-and subjective identities. Such an epistemological turn, however, entails the problem of the dissolution of the material body as a strong foundation for various political claims. From this point on, some argumentative lines will be drawn parting from different segments of the author's thought. These lines tend to present a complex notion of the body, clung to the idea of vulnerability.

In fact, different types of immune cells, such as myeloid, macrophages and denditric cells, are able to modulate tumor neovascularization. On the other hand, tumor microenvironment also includes extracellular matrix components like hyaluronan, which has a deregulated synthesis in different tumors. Hyaluronan is a glycosaminoglycan, normally present in the extracellular matrix of tissues in continuous remodeling (embryogenesis or wound healing processes) and acts as an important modulator of cell behavior by different mechanisms, including angiogenesis. In this review, we discuss hyaluronan as a modulator of tumor angiogenesis, focusing in intracellular signaling mediated by its receptors expressed on different immune cells. Recent observations suggest that the immune system is an important component in tumoural angiogenesis. Therefore, immune modulation could have an impact in anti-angiogenic therapy as a new therapeutic strategy, which in turn might improve effectiveness of treatment in cancer patients.

The article develops the topic of the literature of the time when Marx writes the book, the "literature of sensibility", trying to show its relationship with history. The discussion about the genre the text belongs is important: it is a "farse", wich puts clear what is the meaning of the famous sentence of Marx "history repets itself twice"; the second time as a farse. At last, this article discusses the belonging of Marx to the group of bohme exile wich is the subject of the book.

Several scholars have used those tools to build a better understanding of kirchnerism. This paper aims to complement that explanation by analyzing certain unattended features in a low explored period: that of Adolfo Rodriguez Saa and Eduardo Duhalde's administrations. Those two presidents were not elected by people's vote, and constitute an interregnum between two political orders. What happened in those months? The paper states that it was then when the public policies, the discourse and the shape of accumulation changed, leaving fertile ground for Nestor Kirchner's populist interpellation.

This article looks into some of the characteristics of territoriality in South American regions, paying special attention to the transformations that have taken place in the last decades, in order to look into some of the integration processes that have to do with South America especially with respect to UNASUR block. The focus set on the territory implies that it will be the magnifying glass through which an attempt will be made to have a first rapprochement to the phenomenom, examining the broader and more complex dynamics of power. It begins with an inicial reflexion about how to understand and analysis the territory, overwhelmed by multiple logics and power mechanisms. The process of the debates about the methods of international insertion, as well as for the stages of regionalism in Latin America contribute to the new conditions that are produced in the region when it comes to analysing the emergence of new power blocks. Now we can inquire if Unasur block is based on new logics of power construction. Its study will allow us to look into the challenges that its conformation lays out; as well as at the tensions and conflicts of interest involved in the different integration purposes that coexist in Unasur.

J	Barbero, JJ				Jorge Barbero, Juan			Jose Arico and the "crisis of civilization": the search for a socialist-democratic imbrication for the development of "subjectivity dilatation" (1979-1986)	CUESTIONES DE SOCIOLOGIA			Spanish	Article						Jose Maria Arico; Democratic transition; Hegemony; Advanced social democracy; Carl Schmitt		Moving between political sociology and intellectual history, we will approach aspects of the work of the so called "gramscian argentine" Jose Maria Arico (1931-1991). With a renown political and intellectual activity developed in his country for as long as three decades, the military coup d'tat in 1976 forced Arico to exile. Anchored in Mexico, the theme of democratic transition, present throughout Latin America and Europe, throws him into a series of studies concerning the ties between socialist and democratic traditions, the notion of progress and the disturbing divorce between politics and culture which since the times of World War II continues to deepen. Always with Gramsci work at the core of his questionings, Arico returns to Argentina in 1983. Considering that not even liberalism, nor marxism-leninism, nor populism, nor social democracy can contribute to the conformation of a "strong thinking" of emancipatory expectations, deepening within the theme of "subjectivity dilatation" and in an unbiased study of the work of reactionary german intellectual Carl Schmitt, Arico rehearses an original path, stimulated by the force-idea of a "social advanced democracy", able to give ambitious answers to what he continues to point out as a crisis of civilization.

Techniques in surgical navigation of extremity tumors: state of the art	CURRENT REVIEWS IN MUSCULOSKELETAL MEDICINE			English	Article						Navigation; Orthopedic oncology; Extremities; Bone tumors; Limb salvage		Image-guided surgical navigation allows the orthopedic oncologist to perform adequate tumor resection based on fused images (CT, MRI, PET). Although surgical navigation was first performed in spine and pelvis, recent reports have described the use of this technique in bone tumors located in the extremities. In long bones, this technique has moved from localization or percutaneous resection of benign tumors to complex bone tumor resections and guided reconstructions (allograft or endoprostheses). In recent years, the reported series have increased from small numbers (5 to 16 patients) to larger ones (up to 130 patients). The purpose of this paper is to review recent reports regarding surgical navigation in the extremities, describing the results obtained with different kind of reconstructions when navigation is used and how the previously described problems were solved.

Proximal humeral osteoarticular allografts: technique, pearls and pitfalls, outcomes	CURRENT REVIEWS IN MUSCULOSKELETAL MEDICINE			English	Article						Humerus; Osteoarticular; Allograft		Allograft transplantation is a biologic reconstruction option for massive bone defects after resection of bone sarcomas. This type of reconstruction not only restores bone stock but it also allows us to reconstruct the joint anatomically. These factors are a major concern, especially in a young and active population. We are describing indications, surgical techniques, pearls and pitfalls, and outcomes of proximal humeral osteoarticular allografts, done at present time in our institution. We found that allograft fractures and articular complications, as epiphyseal resorption and subchondral fracture, are the main complications observed in proximal humerus osteoarticular allograft reconstructions. Nevertheless, only fractures need a reconstruction revision. Joint complications may adversely affect the limb function, but for this reason, an allograft revision is rarely performed.

Marking the boundaries of both space and time correspond to the identification of urban transformations during the time of the colonisation, the creation of the Republic, and Art Deco in the most important commercial area of the city. They are in direct relation to the agro-industrial economic model. The article concludes by synthesising the economic and political structure that transformed the society into a republic and how the commercial street led to the overlapping of advertising with the urban landscape, which resulted from the business identifying with development and beauty.

J	Araujo, L; Pels, J				Araujo, Luis; Pels, Jaqueline			Marketization and its limits	DECISION			English	Article						Marketization; Rethinking marketing; Subsistence markets		This commentary provides a short reflection on what marketing should be rethinking. We suggest that marketing should reconsider its relationship to markets, namely in the light of the so-called marketization wave (i.e., the use of market exchange as the principal mode of the coordination of socioeconomic life based on the belief that markets are an inherently superior way of organizing the conception, production and exchange of goods). Our argument is that by dissolving economic into generic exchange, marketing unwittingly finds itself unable to pass comment on marketization whilst occluding its own contribution to the spread of marketization. The question that concerns us is whether marketing, as an academic discipline and as a set of professionalized practices, should engage with the marketization debate and if so, what form should this engagement take. We conclude and call for a more systematic assessment of how marketing practices have societal impact. We argue that marketing theory should pay closer attention to how it contributes to marketization by providing an ideology, a toolkit and expertise to expand the scope of markets. A more reflexive attitude as to how marketing contributes to marketization opens up a space of debate and critique on both the appropriate scope of markets as well as the role of marketing in making and operating markets.

Navigation and Comprehension of Digital Expository Texts: Hypertext Structure, Previous Domain Knowledge, and Working Memory Capacity	ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						digital text; navigation; comprehension; working memory		Introduction. In contemporary information societies, reading digital text has become pervasive. One of the most distinctive features of digital texts is their internal connections via hyperlinks, resulting in non-linear hypertexts. Hypertext structure and previous knowledge affect navigation and comprehension of digital expository texts. From the Cognitive Load framework, working memory capacity would have a role in supporting decisions about navigation, and in situation model construction for comprehension. The present study assessed text structure, previous domain knowledge, and working memory capacity effects on comprehension and navigation of digital expository texts. Method. Fifty-six participants completed a working memory capacity measure, read four digital texts and answered questions about them. Hyperext structure (hierarchical vs. network) and previous thematic knowledge (high vs. low) were manipulated in a within-subjects design. Navigation behavior was indexed taking into account total time spent on each text, total number of pages per text, number of returns to the initial page, and number of nonlinear links clicked. Results. High previous knowledge, and high working memory capacity, led to better comprehension. Participants who read under network interfaces followed less structured navigation paths than those who read hierarchically organized interfaces. On the other hand, high previous knowledge texts led to more pages visited, more non-linear jumps in reading, and more returns to the overview in the Home page in the network condition. Also, total time spent on each text was longer for high working memory participants reading high previous knowledge texts. Discussion. Overall, this pattern of results adds to the literature about the beneficial effects promoted by hierarchical interfaces and concept maps; and the disorientation effects network hypertexts have for low domain knowledge students. On the other hand, given good previous knowledge and high working memory, a more variable pattern of navigation would help readers engage in more active reading processes.

Camguilhem's thought by the Argentinean epistemologist J. Samaja. Our hypothesis is that Samaja receives Canguilhem's health concept from the perspective that he is trying to dismantle: the biologicist positivism as producer of a law that serves as a criterion of demarcation in the biomedical sciences between health and disease. While the French conceived health as the maintenance of a living man within a dynamic standard created by itself, the Argentinean claims that health can not depend on a rule with a biologicist origin: health standards, in itself human cultural, do not respond to biological criteria for listing. This separation between cultura and natura assumed by Samaja keeps him within the schema of positivism, as well as of a western, Aristotelian, Hegelian, etc. ones, which rejects the vital roots of human cultural existence, and therefore within the rules that define the health of the living man.

They have as precedent, the constructions in iron developed in England during the 19th century for small buildings. However, if we make more detailed comparisons, we see that there are significant differences. If the basic material related these homes with the English tradition, their presence, image and constructive resolutions characterize them as a local response to particular social and economic conditions in a stage of national transformation.

United Nations considers that a population is "aged" when more than 7% of the people are older than 60 years (UN Convention of 1956). Mar del Plata is a gerontological pole, because 18% of its population is elder. The main goal of this study is to identify different housing situation for elder living in the city, analyzing the INDEC census data (2010) and its comparison and relation with qualitative data obtained from different studies of our research group. The research of housing conditions and urban environment in Mar del Plata's downtown is a key to identify the overlapping in the network of resources that could complement the domestic habitat. These studies will work as a basis for future interventions which tend to improve the aging of people in the most vulnerable areas.

We will see the questions raised about the city at the heart of the new institutions and technical offices, and then the complex counterpoint process of the making of the cadastral and topographic map.

Concrete art had built a tradition in which the ideas of synthesis, simplicity, beauty and truth were linked together. This approach, which was elemental in the construction of disciplines of design, at least in Argentina, finds its pillar in the New Vision magazine. The protagonism of this magazine has partly eclipsed the role played by university subjects such as "Vision" (which originally appeared in the University of Litoral and was later brought to the University of Buenos Aires) in the construction of a prime discourse on design in our country, which was able to articulate the language of modern architecture with modern art. The purpose of this article is to analyse the way in which the subject "Vision" set a considerable conceptual base for the future development of designs as disciplines.

In order for sanitation to thrive and insert itself into the social ensemble, the argumentative complement of urban embellishment is resorted to as its associated and natural consequence. It is at this point when, united with different collective representations, the sanitation device is made up, both as an ordering instrument of the health of the town, as well as part of a machine, of its aesthetic or formal dimension and, consequently, in a key element of the configuration and characterization of urban sectors. Thus, besides the order and health of the urban ensemble, sanitation would also entail the urban embellishment and parceling; it brings together while it characterizes and divides. These conditions allow the start of a historic research work to be proposed here, where the formal resultants and aesthetic transformations of certain sanitation components become relevant urban interventions and, mainly, it is tried here to develop, with new interpretative elements, alternative hypothesis about its logics in the town.

This philological route poses methodologically as a specific cognitive exercise, which far from intending a unifying or homogeneous reading, will focus on recognizing the different edges that the historiographic discourse has produced from the initial rigid rejection to the current comprehension of its complexity, emphasizing the comprehension of the context of its transformations.

Pressure and shear-induced amorphization of silicon	EXTREME MECHANICS LETTERS			English	Article						Laser shock compression; Silicon; Amorphization; Nanocrystalline Silicon		Here we report that high-power, pulsed, laser-driven shock compression of monocrystalline silicon produces directional amorphization, revealed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and confirmed by molecular dynamics simulations. At the lowest energy level experiment, generating a pressure of similar to 4 GPa, silicon reacts elastically. At intermediate energy levels (P similar to 11 and 22 GPa), amorphization is observed both at the surface and directionally, along planes making angles close to the maximum shear. At the highest laser energy level explored here, (P-peak similar to 28 GPa), the recovered sample shows a nanocrystalline microstructure near the surface. This nanocrystalline structure forms by crystallization from the amorphous phase and is thought to be a post-shock phenomenon. Shearinduced lattice defects (stacking faults and twins) on crystallographic slip planes play a crucial role in the onset of amorphization. Molecular dynamics show that silicon behaves elastically until similar to 10 GPa and, at slightly higher pressures, partial dislocations and stacking faults are emitted from the surface. Driven by the high-amplitude stress pulse, these defects travel inwards along specific crystallographic orientations and intersect, leading to further defect creation, additional plastic work, and, at higher pressures, amorphous bands in intersecting patterns. The typical high-pressure solid-solid phase transitions of silicon are not observed whereas the high shear stresses are relaxed by localized dislocation motion/interactions and eventually by directional amorphization, which occurs below the critical hydrostatic pressure for melting of silicon in shock compression. It is therefore proposed that the combined effects of hydrostatic and shear stresses lead to directional amorphization. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Zhao, S.; Kad, B.; Hahn, E.

Through the actions of social subjects an urban landscape characterized by the presence of citizens and the redefinition of public spaces is configured. The article is a reflection on the interpretation of the social process that grew out of the European crisis, with emphasis on the Spanish context and the "Indignant ones" movement. Personal emotions were channeled in collective social manifestations, where social subjects publicly expressed sentiments that were stored inside, the product of long years of disagreement with the weakening of the European social model. Finally, ideas that reflect a new political and institutional frame showing the bridge between the manifestations of social movements and the transformation and institutionalization of the actions are outlined.

The detailed surgical technique with its variations is explained in this report. The propeller, flip-over, conventional perforator, and muscle-sparing flaps have been described and evaluated. The flaps were partially or completely de-epithelialized. The conventional TDAP can be enlarged or "extended" as the traditional latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous (LD-MC) flap by incorporating the superior and inferior fat compartments. It can be referred to as the "extended TDAP flap". This technique augments the flap volume. In addition, this flap can serve as a scaffold for lipofilling to obtain autologous breast reconstruction in medium to large cases. There were two complete failures due to technical errors during flap elevation. Distal partial tissue suffering was observed in four flaps. These flaps were longer than usual; they reached the midline of the back. It is advisable to discard the distal medial quarter of the flap when it is designed up to the midline to avoid steatonecrosis or fibrosis. A retrospective analysis of the 39 flaps that survived completely revealed a satisfactory result in 82% of the cases. The main disadvantage of this procedure is the final scar. The TDAP flap is a reliable and safe method for partial or total breast autologous reconstruction.

J	Gonzalez, EG; Rancati, AO				Gonzalez, Eduardo G.; Rancati, Alberto O.			Skin-sparing mastectomy	GLAND SURGERY			English	Review						Breast cancer; oncologic breast surgery; oncoplastic breast surgery; skin-sparing mastectomy (SSM)		The surgical treatment of breast cancer has evolved rapidly in recent decades. Conservative treatment was adopted in the late 1970s, with rates above 70%, and this was followed by a period during which the indications for surgical intervention were expanded to those patients at high risk for BRCA1, BRCA2 mutations, and also due to new staging standards and use of nuclear magnetic resonance. This increase in the indications for mastectomy coincided with the availability of immediate breast reconstruction as an oncologically safe and important surgical procedure for prevention of sequelae. Immediate reconstruction was first aimed at correcting the consequences of treatment, and almost immediately, the challenge of the technique became the achievement of a satisfactory breast appearance and shape, as well as normal consistency. The skin-sparing mastectomy (SSM) in conservation first and nipple-areola complex (NAC) later was a result of this shift that occurred from the early 1990s to the present. The objective of this review is to present all these developments specifically in relation to SSM and analyze our personal experience as well as the experience of surgeons worldwide with an emphasis on the fundamental aspects, indications, surgical technique, complications, oncological safety, and cosmetic results of this procedure.

Clinical characteristics of bipolar disorder: a comparative study between Argentina and the United States	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIPOLAR DISORDERS			English	Article						Argentina; Bipolar disorder; Clinical characteristics; Comparative; Early onset; Onset age; Prescription patterns; United States		Background: Bipolar disorder presents with diverse clinical manifestations. Numerous investigators have sought to identify variables that may predict a more severe illness course. Methods: With the objective of studying the clinical characteristics of bipolar patients between South and North America, a comparison was performed between a sample from Argentina (n = 449) and a sample from the United States (n = 503) with respect to demographics and clinical characteristics, including presence of comorbidities. Results: The Argentinian sample had more unfavorable demographics and higher rates of prior psychiatric hospitalization and prior suicide attempt but a better social outcome. However, the sample from the United States had a higher rate of prior year rapid cycling, as well as younger bipolar disorder onset age (mean +/- SD, 17.9 +/- 8.4 vs. 27.1 +/- 11.4 years) and more severe clinical morbidity, though there was no significant difference in terms of the total duration of the illness. Argentinian compared to American patients were taking more mood stabilizers and benzodiazepines/hypnotics, but fewer antipsychotics and other psychotropic medications, when considering patients in aggregate as well as when stratifying by illness subtype (bipolar I versus bipolar II) and by illness onset age (<= 21 vs. >21 years). However, there was no significant difference in rate of antidepressant prescription between the two samples considered in aggregate. Conclusions: Although possessing similar illness durations, these samples presented significant clinical differences and distinctive prescription patterns. Thus, though the Argentinian compared to North American patients had more unfavorable demographics, they presented a better social outcome and, in several substantive ways, more favorable illness characteristics. In both samples, early onset (age <= 21 years) was a marker for poor prognosis throughout the illness course, although this phenomenon appeared more robust in North America.

Switch to mania after ayahuasca consumption in a man with bipolar disorder: a case report	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIPOLAR DISORDERS			English	Article						Ayahuasca; Bipolar disorder; DSM 5; Switch to mania; MAO inhibitors		Background: There is an increasing use of ayahuasca for recreational purposes. Furthermore, there is a growing evidence for the antidepressant properties of its components. However, there are no reports on the effects of this substance in the psychiatric setting. Harmaline, one of the main components of ayahuasca, is a selective and reversible MAO-A inhibitor and a serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Case report: We present the case of a man with bipolar disorder who had a manic episode after an ayahuasca consumption ritual. This patient had had at least one hypomanic episode in the past and is currently depressed. We discuss the diagnostic repercussion of this manic episode. Conclusion: There is lack of specificity in the diagnosis of substance-induced mental disorder. The knowledge of the pharmacodynamic properties of ayahuasca consumption allows a more physiopathological approach to the diagnosis of the patient.

Glare by Light Emitting Diode (LED) vehicle traffic signals	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL AND MATERIALS ENGINEERING			English	Article								Background: In this paper we analyze devices for traffic signals (traffic lights) with light-emitting diode (LED) technology. Methods: The traditional measurements of luminous intensity were complemented with the luminance analysis of the devices, evaluated for diverse angular fields. Besides, a subjective glare evaluation is presented. In the experience, signals with LEDs directly visible and signals with refractors are compared. Both signals were introduced in the visual field of 30 observers within a perceptive scene that simulated night vision conditions for a driver. The observers were later inquired about the experienced perturbation or discomfort sensation. Results: The obtained results show a significant increase in the punctual luminance as well as an evident perturbation and discomfort for the observers.

Among the main causes are identified sub-diagnosed genetic mutations; prescription, interaction, self-medication or abuse of suspected drugs due to internet prospect's consult; and a parasitic pandemia, the Chagas disease (over 100000000 population is potentially infected worldwide). Promoting a global extensive determination of the torsadogenic index which was successfully published in Frontiers of Pharmacology Journal, will allow to monitor general population, set security patterns to categorize silent high risk groups of serious prognosis of tachyarrhythmias. For this purpose, applications of known QT determinations are proposed, recommending Dr. Rautaharju's formula, actually improved with gender adult versions. Torsadogenic index will allow to establish an individual traceability, obtain comparative samples that are alert to possible QT enlargements. Thus, torsadogenic index results a valuable, simple and costless resource to consider in the fight against acute death and cardiac arrest. Torsadogenic index represents a global indicator capable of predicting and preventing acute death and heart failure for most relevant reasons.

The product characteristics and therapeutic performance of non-biological complex drugs are largely defined by the manufacturing process. A follow-on product, termed herein as ferric carboxymaltose similar, is available in India. Given that non-biological complex drugs may display differences in diverse product properties not characterisable by physico-chemical methods alone. Aim: The aim is to assess the effects of this ferric carboxymaltose similar in our non-clinical model in non-anaemic healthy rats. Materials and Methods: Non-anaemic rats were treated with intravenous ferric carboxymaltose similar or iron sucrose both at (40 mg iron/kg body weight), or with saline solution (control) for four weeks, after which the animals were sacrificed. Parameters for tissue iron distribution, oxidative stress, nitrosative stress, inflammation and apoptosis were assessed by immunohistomorphometry. Results: Ferric carboxymaltose similar resulted in deranged iron distribution versus iron sucrose originator as indicated by increased serum iron, transferrin saturation and tissue iron(III) deposits as well as decreased ferritin deposits in the liver, heart and kidneys versus iron sucrose originator. Ferric carboxymaltose similar also increased significantly oxidative/nitrosative stress, pro-inflammatory, and apoptosis markers in the liver, heart and kidneys versus iron sucrose originator. Conclusion: In our rat model, ferric carboxymaltose similar had a less favourable safety profile than iron sucrose originator, adversely affecting iron deposition, oxidative and nitrosative stress, inflammatory responses, with impaired liver and kidney function.

Single-Dose Universal Hepatitis A Immunization in Argentina: Low Viral Circulation and High Persistence of Protective Antibodies Up to 4 Years	JOURNAL OF THE PEDIATRIC INFECTIOUS DISEASES SOCIETY			English	Article						Argentina; hepatitis A; immunogenicity; single-dose vaccination; viral circulation		Background: Single-dose hepatitis A virus (HAV) vaccination was implemented in all Argentinean children aged 12 months in 2005. Between 2005 and 2011, a dramatic decline was observed in HAV infection rates, fulminant hepatitis, and liver transplantation. This study assessed current viral circulation and estimated protective antibody persistence 4 years after vaccination. Methods: Prevalence of prevaccination anti-HAV antibodies in 12-month-old children was evaluated as an indirect estimation of viral circulation (Group A). Seroprevalence was also measured in 5-year-old children who received 1 dose of HAV vaccine at 1 year of age (Group B). Blood samples were tested for immunoglobulin (Ig)G anti-HAV antibodies (seroprotection = >= 10 mIU/mL). All Group A-positive samples were tested for IgM anti-HAV antibodies to identify recent infections. Logistic regression analysis was done to evaluate associations between demographic and socioeconomic variables and seroprotection. Results: Of 433 children from Group A, 29.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 25.2-33.8) were positive for IgG anti-HAV antibodies with a geometric mean concentration (GMC) of 6.17 mIU/mL (95% CI, 5.33-7.15 mIU/mL); all IgM anti-HAV were negative. From 1139 in Group B, 93% (95% CI, 91.7-94.6) maintained seroprotection with a GMC of 97.96 mIU/mL (95% CI, 89.21-107.57 mIU/mL). Kindergarten attendance was associated with seroprotection in Group B (odds ratio [OR], 2.0; 95% CI, 1.26-3.3). In contrast, high maternal educational level was associated with a lack of seroprotection in this group (OR, .26; 95% CI, .09-.8). Conclusions: Single-dose, universal hepatitis A immunization in infants resulted in low HAV circulation and persistent immunologic protection up to 4 years in Argentina. Variables associated with presence or absence of seroprotection in vaccinated children could be related to differences in hygiene habits in settings with residual viral circulation.

J	Piglia, M				Piglia, Melina			Motor clubs in the public arena: the Argentine Automobile Club, the Argentine Touring Club and the construction of a National Roads System (1910-43)	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT HISTORY			English	Article						Argentina; motorists associations; roads policy; automobility		The rapid spread of the automobile in the early twentieth century posed both challenges and promises to nation states. Before automobility became the object of public policies, this new mobility technology had to be socially perceived and constructed as belonging to the public sphere. Motorist associations played a decisive role in this process. This paper focuses on the Argentine Automobile Club (ACA) and the Argentine Touring Club (TCA), the two principal automobile clubs in the country and the largest ones in Latin America during the first half of the twentieth century. It argues that the ACA and TCA had a decisive influence during the 1920s in diagnosing and listing possible solutions to road and tourism challenges, and providing reference points for most of the road and tourism policies in the following decades. At the same time, both clubs actively helped to create a national network of roads through their participation in the planning agencies and made the new roadways accessible by signposting them and by providing petrol stations. Not least they formed and spread the new practices of road culture and automobility and, by organising sporting events, tours and rally drives and printing travel guides and maps, they contributed to the symbolic construction of the roads.

Although cholecystectomy is the indicated treatment of this entity, it cannot be performed in some high-risk surgery patients, such as critically ill or those with multiple comorbidities. In these non-uncommon scenarios, percutaneous cholecystostomy is the recommended alternative treatment, which allows immediate decompression and drainage of the acutely inflamed gallbladder and thus reducing the patient's symptoms and the systemic inflammatory response. Ultrasound is the imaging method of choice to guide the percutaneous cholecystostomy procedure due to its real-time guidance, lack of ionizing radiation and portability, avoiding the need to transfer unhealthy patients to the radiology department. We will review the ultrasound-guided percutaneous cholecystostomy procedure, of special interest for radiologists, surgeons, and also intensive care and emergency physicians.

J	Gonzalez, L; Elgart, JF; Gagliardino, JJ				Gonzalez, Lorena; Federico Elgart, Jorge; Jose Gagliardino, Juan			Education of people with type 2 diabetes through peers with diabetes: is it cost effective?	MEDWAVE			Spanish	Article						cost-effectiveness analysis; education; diabetes mellitus type 2		INTRODUCTION Inadequate quality of care provided to people with type 2 diabetes mellitus, generates a significant socioeconomic burden and a serious public health problem. Diabetes education through peers with diabetes is an alternative to that provided by professional educators (traditional education) which achieves non-inferior results. However, there is little evidence of cost-effectiveness of education trough peers over traditional education. OBJECTIVE To evaluate cost-effectiveness of education of people with type 2 diabetes mellitus, during a year, by a team of professional educators (traditional education) versus education and support delivered by trained peers with diabetes. METHODS Cost-effectiveness analysis based on a randomized prospective clinical study conducted in the city of La Plata, including 199 people with type 2 diabetes mellitus, divided in two groups:, one receiving traditional education and another receiving the same education but delivered by peer educators with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Change in glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was considered as a primary indicator of effectiveness and secondary indicators were others, such as body mass index, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, total cholesterol and triglyceride levels. The direct cost of each strategy was estimated based on resources used in the trial, evaluating three cost scenarios for peer education. The strength of the results was assessed by univariate sensitivity analysis. RESULTS Cost per unit decrease (%) in HbA1c: traditional education: $2 621; peer education: $1 508, $1 779 y $2 071 for each of the three scenarios considered (scenario 1, scenario 2, scenario 3), respectively. For each $100 invested a decrease of 0.04% in the HbA1c with traditional education was achieved; and 0.07% in scenario 1; 0.06% in scenario 2 and 0.05% in scenario 3, with education delivered by peer educators. Sensitivity analysis showed the strength of the results. CONCLUSION Education of type 2 diabetes mellitus patients through peers as a complement to control and treatment of the disease, is cost-effective compared to traditional education.

J	Lifschitz, C				Lifschitz, Carlos			Early Life Factors Influencing the Risk of Obesity	PEDIATRIC GASTROENTEROLOGY HEPATOLOGY & NUTRITION			English	Review						Obesity; Infant formula; Low protein formula; Cesarean section		The obesity epidemic is a worldwide problem. Factors predisposing to obesity include genetics, race, socioeconomic conditions, birth by cesarean section, and perinatal antibiotic use. High protein (HP) content in infant formulas has been identified as a potential culprit predisposing to rapid weight gain in the first few months of life and leading to later obesity. In a large multicountry study the effects of lower protein (LP) formula (1.77 and 2.2 g protein/100 kcal, before and after the 5th month, respectively) were compared to those of higher protein (2.9 and 4.4 g protein/100 kcal, respectively). Results indicated that at 24 months, the weight-for-length z score of infants in the LP formula group was 0.20 (0.06, 0.34) lower than that of the HP group and was similar to that of the breastfed reference group. The authors concluded that a HP content of infant formula is associated with higher weight in the first 2 years of life but has no effect on length. LP intake in infancy might diminish the later risk of overweight and obesity. At 6 years of age HP children had a significantly higher body mass index (by 0.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.13-0.90; p=0.009) and a 2.43 (95% CI, 1.12-5.27; p=0.024) fold greater risk of becoming obese than those who received the LP. In conclusion, several factors may influence development of metabolic syndrome and obesity. Breastfeeding should always be encouraged. An overall reduction of protein intake in formula non breastfed infants seems to be an additional way to prevent obesity.

Judaism has been present in Giorgio Agamben's entire work, particularly in his great philosophical project, Homo sacer. Few thinkers from the second half of the twentieth century, such as the Italian philosopher, have incorporated Judaism into the modern philosophical and political debate, updating it and reflecting from the particularity of the concepts to the vicissitudes of the Jewish people's history.

It encloses theoretical framework about the problem of bullying and violence among children at school. It presents information about the region, some common aggressive behaviors as well as different ways and places in which those violent habits might be produced, according to children. Describes school populations suffering from such practices and analyzes some differences from school years, gender and zonal characteristics. It also shows samples of Victimization Rate and General Aggression Rate got in the area. Open to further discussion, this work provides certain description about some bullying phenomenon in the area, such as the case of the "Round-up Effect", produced by the lack of anonymity in barely populated places.This article presents new emerging issues in the research field, like the appearance of new ways of violence, related to digital communication technologies such as instant messaging, e-mail, chat, blog, photoblog and social networks. To conclude, it offers some ideas about the construction of Early Warning Devices and Early Intervention Devices.

J	Contini, EN				Norma Contini, E.			Aggressiveness and social skills in adolescence. A conceptual approach	PSICODEBATE-PSICOLOGIA CULTURA Y SOCIEDAD			Spanish	Article						aggressiveness; social skills; adolescents		The aim of this article is to revise the concept of aggressiveness by defining the overlapping with other concepts, such as aggression, violence, hostility and anger. The subject is focused on adolescence since the relationship to others becomes relevant to defining identity at this stage. Some explanatory models are developed as they are considered important to understand the phenomenon and they provide concepts to approach the growing demand for psychological counselling. Among the theories, we can highlight the one which conceptualises aggressiveness as a dysfunction in social skills, in the interpersonal relationships that affect the adolescent's overall health. Finally, the scope and limits of the theories are analysed and the possibility of integrating models which allow gaining a multidimensional perspective on aggressiveness as a scourge trending upwards in contemporary society is opened up.

J	Nieri, L				Nieri, Liliana			Construction and validation of the Paternal Sensitivity Questionnaire	PSICODEBATE-PSICOLOGIA CULTURA Y SOCIEDAD			Spanish	Article						fatherhood; transition; pregnancy		For decades, various research argued that the father's role was that of economic provider and support of your partner. However, with the historical changes that were happening in recent decades, many psychologists were interested in knowing what the roles of the father were and that happened to the father during the pregnancy of her son. That is why this study aimed to construct an instrument to learn, evaluate and analyze how the father felt regarding the arrival of his son, and also know the various emotions presented in each stage of pregnancy. One concludes that the father from early pregnancy through a process of construction to parenthood, unlike investigations suggest that the father realizes his recent paternity when he first sees her son, was found to father begins its transition from the decision to have a child. And the way how this transition takes place will depend on various factors such as: the story as a child, his relationship with his father, personality type, marital status, current situation, among others.

Nevertheless, the potential shift inherent to neural plasticity, individual differences, and the potential change of self-regulatory development by means of environment intervention (i.e., family, school, and community) also show that impacts are not the same for every child, that there is no critical period for cognitive development and learning competencies that is limited to the first 1,000 days, that irreversibility of poverty impact is not a fact that affects every child exposed to it, and that poverty does not necessary means developmental deficit.(C) 2015 Colegio Oficial de Psicologos de Madrid.

Furthermore, it could affect the ways that social practices of emancipation might be regarded. In this respect, and starting out with a very specific consideration of the notion of "people" and "the political", my intention is to analyze the different interpretations (critical and enthusiastic perspectives) about the judicialization of politics. Finally, I ask about the possibility of exploring the political - emancipatory potential of judicial disputes.

The importance of physiology on insect geographical distribution	REVISTA DE LA SOCIEDAD ENTOMOLOGICA ARGENTINA			English	Article								Finding an explanation to the distribution pattern of species is a main issue in ecology. There are many studies showing correlations between abiotic factors and latitude or altitude and species distribution. However, these approaches fail in providing causal relations and mechanisms involved in large scale pattern of species distribution. This article briefly introduces the field of macrophysiology, a new research area that was developed 10 to 15 years ago and combines macroecology with environmental physiology or ecophysiology. This new area allows approaching the question of species distribution patterns from a mechanistic point of view. Insects are an excellent model system to perform this kind of studies due to their world-wide distribution, easy laboratory breeding and handling to perform experiments. In particular, the macrophysiological approach would help improving predictions of actual and future species distribution in a changing world, including global warming, which it would be of great importance especially with invasive insects, pests or disease vectors.

L. botrana was first identified in 2010 in Mendoza. The aim of this study is to adjust the model of Touzeau to predict the behavior of the moth. The study has been conducted since 2012 in a vineyard cv. Malbec. Pheromone traps have been used. The temperature is recorded by a datalogger sensor. Thermal integral is calculated with Touzeau's formula using a threshold of 1000 as July 1(st) of each year. Results indicate that the first flight happened on October 18(th) the first year and October 20(th) the second year with 204. 05 +/- 10.73 degree days. The second occurred in the first ten days of December in two following seasons with 728.34 +/- 41.95 degree days.

In order to contribute to the biological control of aphids, the objective of this study was to identify plant-aphid-parasitoid trophic interactions occurring in crop fields and their vegetated borders and to provide an identification key for parasitoids recorded in the province of Santa Fe (Aphidiidae and Aphelinidae). Over four years, (2009-2013), 10 transects of 0.5 m in crops (alfalfa, oats, wheat and canola) and non-crop edges were randomly selected in 28 fields from six districts of the province. Samples of each observed species were taken and mummies (parasitized aphids) were reared in the laboratory, until adult emergence, for identification. Regional matrix for plantaphid-parasitoid interaction registered in crops and non-crop and useful aspects for aphid pest control are discussed. Known host ranges for eleven species of paresitoids were expanded and an illustrated key based on female morphology of both groups of parasitoids, and another based on mummies morphology and other evidences of parasitoids emergence from their hosts, were provided.

New associations between Phasiinae (Diptera: Tachinidae) and Pentatomidae (Hemiptera: Heteroptera) phytophagous insects in the rolling pampa (Argentina) and description of Dallasimyia bosqi Blanchard male	REVISTA DE LA SOCIEDAD ENTOMOLOGICA ARGENTINA			Spanish	Article								The relationships between Phasiinae (Diptera:Tachinidae) parasitoid flies and their Pentatomidae (Hemiptera: Heteroptera) hosts are little known in Argentina. We present new host-parasitoid associations in the rolling pampa, and describe for the first time the adult male of Dallasimyia bosqi Blanchard. Adult Hemiptera were sampled biweekly during spring-summer 2005, 2006 and 2012 in areas of natural vegetation and crops of red clover and soybean, in fields in La Plata, Magdalena and Chivilcoy counties (Buenos Aires province). The Hemiptera were reared under controlled conditions; those with parasitoid macrotype eggs stuck on the corium were kept till death, and those with no signs of parasitism were kept for up to 25-30 days. Each dead host was placed in a container with damp soil and covered with a nylon mesh. The adult parasitoids emerged were conditioned for identification. Five new associations were recorded: E. meditabunda - Cilindromyia brasiliana (Townsend) and Homogenia sp., D. furcatus - Trichopoda argentinensis (Blanchard) and Dallasimyia bosqi, and C. armigera - Trichopoda giacomellii (Blanchard) as well as the already known N. viridula - Trichopoda giacomellii. Reference collections are deposited in the Museo de La Plata, Argentina (MCNLP) and in the Museu de Zoologia da Universidade de Sao Paulo, Brazil (MZSP).

Recent invasion of the Tierra del Fuego Archipelago by the wasp Vespula germanica (Hymenoptera: Vespidae)	REVISTA DE LA SOCIEDAD ENTOMOLOGICA ARGENTINA			Spanish	Article								Vespula germanica is an invasive worldwide species that has been detected in continental Patagonia of Argentina and Chile. In this work, we extend the range of this invasive wasp in Patagonia to include the Tierra del Fuego Archipelago. We indicate the location, year and habitat of each sighting and/or collection. The expansion pattern of this species indicates that it is well established in natural and anthropogenic areas and that it has most probably depended on human transport to arrive from the continent. This short communication also provides information to take practical measures for its mitigation and control, including basic information for the citizens of the island to become aware of its presence and help it not arrive to new areas. Finally, more research is recommended for management and control of this new invasive species in Tierra del Fuego.

IMMUNIZATION STATUS OF HEALTH PROFESSIONALS AND TECHNICIANS BELONGING TO THE HEALTH TEAM FROM STATE HOSPITALS OF THE PROVINCE OF CORDOBA, ARGENTINA	REVISTA DE SALUD PUBLICA-CORDOBA			Spanish	Article						Immunization coverage; Health staff; Vaccines; Occupational Exposure	HEPATITIS-B VACCINATION; CARE WORKERS; PREVENTABLE DISEASES; COVERAGE; ATTITUDES; INFLUENZA	Objective: To determine the immunization status of health professionals and technicians belonging to the health team from state hospitals of the province of Cordoba regarding Hepatitis B vaccine; Measles and Rubella vaccine; Measles, Mumps and Rubella Vaccine (MMR); Diphtheria and Tetanus vaccine (DT); and influenza (flu) vaccine. Methods: A cross sectional study was carried out on a sample of 844 workers from public hospitals belonging to the Ministry of Health of the province of Cordoba during the years 2013 and 2014. A self administered questionnaire was used and univariate analysis and bivariate analysis were done. For the assessment of factors associated with vaccination, chi square statistics was applied; a 5% margin of error was defined (p <= 0.05) and a confidence interval of 95 %. Results: The proportion of professionals and technicians with coverage was: Diphtheria and Tetanus Vaccine (DT) 87.2%, Hepatitis B vaccine 77.6%, MMR vaccine or Measles and Rubella vaccine 69.0% and influenza vaccine 55.2%. Better immunization status was found among those with higher education, less seniority, and younger age with significant differences regarding sex in hepatitis B and less seniority in Measles and Rubella vaccine. Conclusion: The workers studied present an immunization status below the one internationally recommended. However, it is similar or higher to the level reported in different countries, showing that the under-coverage of health professionals is an outspread problem that must be prioritized by the authorities, given the implications for the workers themselves and the population they assist.

To do this, the study was centered in the four Reference Regional Centers (RRC) that exist in Gran Resistencia; former neighborhood Health Centers which today offer a greater complexity level. Geographic accessibility is defined as how easy it is for the patients to use the service at the time they want or need it. The main source of information for this research is a survey carried out in the year 2010 to a sample of the population who goes to the RRCs. As main significant conclusions we can mention that the distances the users have to cover, the means of transport they have to use as well as road conditions represent a barrier and place their health at risk.

This reality is observed in public health care centers in the city of Rio Cuarto. We critically think about the definition of the health-illness processes, comparing the current paradigms and Psychmotricity theory and asking about the ways in which the inclusion of this discipline is understood in the provincial public policies and in the legislation in force. The research was carried out through field work to get to know the opinion and assessment regarding health care and psychomotricity care and its legal framework by means of surveys and interviews to health social actors: doctors and local civil servants, among others. It is observed that the constitution of the health teams is incomplete; there exists professional bias which is still priorly constituted by the medical sciences. The intention of our analysis is to contrast medical knowledge and psychomotricity knowledge to set up reflection spaces which will allow the necessary transformations to take care of health recovery, prevention and promotion.

The work is based on a Survey about Use and Expenditure on Health Services carried out in the year 2010 together by CEDOP (UBA) and DEIS (MSAL). As a result, we see that there are differential financial obstacles to make appointments with different health professionals. Those who see a dentist, a psychologist or a psychiatrist have to spend more of their "own" money than those who see a doctor. The main reason explaining this differential expenditure is the different coverage the Argentine system provides for the appointments with professionals.

We worked with deep interviews to 20 people belonging to different neighborhoods in the capital city of the province of Neuquen, Argentina. Existing statistics for the population under study were also reviewed. As a conclusion, the homes studied are considered vulnerable to food insecurity since most of the enumerated factors affect food security negatively and those with more encouraging characteristics do not have consolidated assets to face adversities without suffering important risks as regards the nutritional situation of each of their members.

Available vaccines are reviewed, as well as use recommendations and controversy regarding effectiveness, security, required doses, prevention efficiency and people's participation. HPV vaccines offer a promising approach to prevent cervical cancer and conditions associated with these viruses, but they do not replace other prevention strategies since they do not protect against all HPV types.

Utilization of satellite images to study the thermal distribution in different soil covers in Bahia Blanca city (Argentina)	REVISTA DE TELEDETECCION			Spanish	Article						Remote Sensing; LST; Bahia Blanca; Urban Climate; Soil Coverage		The study of the urban climate is relevant to increase the knowledge about the environment where live most of the world's population. Cities have areas that include buildings, green spaces, un-vegetated soils, transit, among others. Currently, scientists are focusing on the effects of climate change in cities. There is a shortage of studies that analyze the thermal changes that occur in the inner city due to the densification of buildings. For these reasons, the aim of this study was to analyze the spatial distribution of Land Surface Temperature (LST) and its relation with different soil covers in Bahia Blanca city, Argentina. Satellite images from Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 7 ETM+ were analyzed with single-channel method. Besides, it was made a soil coverage map through visual interpretation of satellite images and it was validated with field trips. LST data were compared with each soil coverage. In downtown, the LST was heterogeneous and presented spatial variations according to the season and the shadows of the buildings. The maximum values of LST were localized in the periphery (45.1 degrees C) and in urban very sparse (46 degrees C) and the minimum in downtown (2 degrees C). Each soil cover had minor fluctuations in the winter (>5 degrees C) and higher in the summer (15 to 25 degrees C).	[Ferrelli, F.; Bustos, M. L.; Huamantinco-Cisneros, M. A.; Piccolo, M.

Determination of agricultural land use: incidence of atmospheric corrections and the implementation in multi-sensor and multi-temporal images	REVISTA DE TELEDETECCION			English	Article						Argentina; Landsat 8; maximum likelihood; neural networks; SPOT 5		Soil coverage and its modifications are critical variables in human-environmental sciences. Changes in land use are causes and consequences of climate change. This situation makes that detailed and updated information is needed for many applications. Remote sensing provides data of large areas periodically, so it becomes a useful input to soil classification. The objectives of this work were to determinate algorithm and images combination that produces the best results to classify agricultural land and, simultaneously, evaluate the need of making atmospheric corrections over them, when classifying multi-temporal/multi-sensor series. The two supervised classification algorithms used were neural networks and maximum likelihood. In the study area, agriculture is the main land use, predominantly summer crops, and the area sown with soybean, corn and sorghum account for over 90% of the total. Time series of Landsat 8 and SPOT 5 images were used, and 164 plots were registered to train and validate the models as ground truth. Maximum likelihood and neural networks models produce very good results when multi-temporal/multi-sensor series are used, with global accuracy between 79.17% to 90.14% and Kappa index between 60% to 82%. The radiometric correction at surface level did not improve the results when the reflectance was corrected at the top of the atmosphere. The time series that use images taken in more advanced phenological stages of crops produce better coverage classifications than time series that use images from early stages.

J	Sanz, AR				Ramos Sanz, Alba			REDUCTION OF THE THERMAL DEMAND OF PRODUCTION IN WINERIES LOCATED IN AN ARID CLIMATE USING SEMI-EMPIRICAL THERMAL MODELING	REVISTA HABITAT SUSTENTABLE			Spanish	Article						Efficiency; climate; winemaking; thermal modeling; receptacle		The study of a sample of three wineries in San Juan, Argentina reveals that energy demand (DE) in winemaking is related to the thermal processes that occur inside winemaking receptacles (EV). These processes determine the quality of the wine, range from fermentation to storage, and require a certain thermal stringency, which is likewise referred to in this article as wine comfort. To determine the influence of an arid climate on wine comfort conditions and the resulting DE for thermal conditioning, a semi-empirical modeling tool was designed. With this instrument it is possible to test the thermal processes of wine fermentation and storage during warm (fermentation and storage) and cold seasons (storage). The modeling results confirm that an increase in the thermal inertia of the EVs promotes heat load reduction (QT), which affects the winery's DE.

Air temperature was obtained using the TvX method on a broad sampling of relationships between the normalized vegetation index NDVI and surface temperature. Thermal data was combined with meteorological records from a weather station located in the city center. This information was quantified and related to the city's urban characteristic bands and the seasonal heat island, the latter of which was obtained by processing the same 2011 satellite images. The results validate and expand those obtained from previous in situ fieldwork regarding the bioclimatic effect of green space in arid urban environments. Lastly, the efficiency of the use of remote sensing for urban studies whose results can be applied to bioclimatic urban design is verified.

For centuries, dwelling in this territory has been a challenge due to both the climate/environment and sociopolitical conditions. Therefore, the drylands habitat has specific characteristics regarding its form of management (autonomous), adaptation to the environment, and the use of the raw earth construction technique, adobe. This research focuses on the current use of adobe, which is conceived as a medium that facilitates the self-building and self-production of housing solutions in deprived populations, and adapts dwellings to the consequences of an arid territory and a long process of rights infringement. This article presents the first results of surveys conducted on the adobe construction technique (using quantitative techniques: survey and samples in situ) and the characteristics of the social habitat of the native Huarpe population based on the participant observation technique.

Nowadays, one of the most common problem, which is difficult to control due to these load demands, is reflective cracking, a phenomenon that explains the propagation of existing cracks in lower layers or coinciding with joint movements of an aged pavement, towards the new reinforcement layer, which copies the pathology of the same. The study evaluates the behavior of reflective cracking while varying the location of the geosynthetic material between each asphalt mix layer, and subjecting the system to dynamic loading. The geosynthetic reinforcement considerably delays the progression of the crack, and the greatest effectiveness is obtained when this material is located nearest to the most stressed fiber of the reinforcement layer.

Violence Risk Assessment Practices in Denmark: A Multidisciplinary National Survey	SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF FORENSIC SCIENCE			English	Article						Risk assessment; violence; multidisciplinary survey; forensic psychiatry; HCR-20; START; PCL-R; PCL-SV		With a quadrupling of forensic psychiatric patients in Denmark over the past 20 years, focus on violence risk assessment practices across the country has increased. However, information is lacking regarding Danish risk assessment practice across professional disciplines and clinical settings; little is known about how violence risk assessments are conducted, which instruments are used for what purposes, and how mental health professionals rate their utility and costs. As part of a global survey exploring the application of violence risk assessment across 44 countries, the current study investigated Danish practice across several professional disciplines and settings in which forensic and high-risk mental health patients are assessed and treated. In total, 125 mental health professionals across the country completed the survey. The five instruments that respondents reported most commonly using for risk assessment, risk management planning and risk monitoring were Broset, HCR-20, the START, the PCL-R, and the PCL: SV. Whereas the HCR-20 was rated highest in usefulness for risk assessment, the START was rated most useful for risk management and risk monitoring. No significant differences in utility were observed across professional groups. Unstructured clinical judgments were reported to be faster but more expensive to conduct than using a risk assessment instrument. Implications for clinical practice are discussed.

We have naturalised the notion of an exclusive border, that is, one which divides an A territory from a non-A, according to the aristotelian law of the excluded third. When studying ancient societies we must necessarily abandon such preconceptions. In this paper we examine the pertinence of using the concept of "border" to understand (not only physical) divisions in Ancient Egypt. Minding the extensive use of stelae in the marking of spatial boundaries throughout egyptian history and based on the careful study of stelae, we aim to discern what is it that they separate and why they are used in that fashion. We will study the cases of both the boundary stelae of the city of Akhetaten and the so-called false-door stelae in order to illustrate our theses. The first ones, erected to be seen, mark a physical limit, while the second group, occult inside private tombs, signals the border between the world of the living and that of the dead. Aparently different, they have on the contrary the same function: to separate cosmic regions, keeping Chaos outside of the territory where Order rules.

J	Bretal, E				Bretal, Eleonora			The military times. Representations and classifications of the ex workers of Swift related to political and state violence	SOCIOHISTORICA-CUADERNOS DEL CISH			Spanish	Article						Working class; Dictatorship; Social representations		The approach of this article are the modes of evoquing the most resonant events about political, parastatal and state violence in the decade of 1970, linked to the factory, by the ex worker's Swift meat plant in Berisso. I analize the ex worker ' s narratives, built it through in-depth interviews, from those who were left-wing militants and from another with differents political orientations and atittudes in relation to trade unionism. In one hand, I explore the traces of social disciplining in the narrated experiences and the dilution of it significance in some cases. In another hand, I show an heterogeneity of senses attributed to two native expressiones that structure the narratives and allude to two social groups: who were entered into something and who were entered into nothing. Besides I present the diffused caracter of the boundary between both groups and some valorations regarding to perceive political and state violences as equal.

J	Cerruti, P				Cerruti, Pedro			Appropriations of the past and closures of memory in the discourses on "insecurity" during the postdictatorship Argentina.	SOCIOHISTORICA-CUADERNOS DEL CISH			Spanish	Article						Insecurity; Memory; Violence; Recent past		This paper studies the discourses of social violence that in post-dictatorship Argentina have been organized around "insecurity" as a public-political problem, in order to analyze the relationships they establish with the dictatorial past. To do this, I consider from a genealogical perspective three moments in the construction of "insecurity": the 1989 "lootings", the second presidency of Menem from 1995 to 1999 and the "BlumbergCrusade" in 2004. This analysis allows to show the ways in which these discourses involved interventions in the memory of the dictatorial past that, on the one hand, were oriented in the sense of producing a closure of the remembering of state terrorism; and, on the other, reconverted key elements of the discourses about violence inherent to the repressive practices in the public life of democratic Argentina.

J	Garatte, L				Garatte, Luciana			Radical leaders and academic groups of Sciences of Education during the "normalization" of the National University of La Plata (1983-1986)	SOCIOHISTORICA-CUADERNOS DEL CISH			Spanish	Article						Perspectives; Experiences; Academic groups; Sciences of Education; University normalization; National University of La Plata		This article is part of a research that had as an aim to investigate the perspectives and experiences that the academic groups of Sciences of Education of the National University of La Plata developed with relation to the policy of university normalization between 1983 and 1986 in order to legitimize their position and to orientate the reform of the programme of studies of their career. Regulations, preliminary designs and programmes of studies, documents and institutional publications, and semistructured interviews were analyzed using a methodological qualitative design. As a result, it was possible to describe the characteristics that the university normalization assumed in the studied case, the elements of continuity and break that were registered in the institutional dynamics with reference to the period of military dictatorship and the social configuration of the academic groups of Sciences of Education that rejoined to university life. The approval of the new programme of studies made evident the social efficiency of a plot of links of diverse content - academic, professional, political, personalized in the positions of the agents in the university government and, in consequence, in the definition of the curricular reform.

Kirchner's government contributed to re- legitimite political system from the construction of a hegemonic political project, in alliance with unions, particularly with sectors that had resisted neoliberal policies in the ' 90s. This alliance has gone into crisis by the end of 2010, and openly expressed in 2012. In this paper we aim to rebuilt the general features of the relation between kirchnerismo and unionism from the analysis of labour policy and changes to the workers movement and labour forces.

Surgical Considerations of the Cystic Duct and Heister Valves	SURGERY JOURNAL-NEW YORK			English	Article						cystic duct; biliary tract; Heister valves; transcystic exploration		Objectives Heister valves are mucosal folds located on the endoluminal surface of the cystic duct (CD) and were first described by Lorenz Heister in 1732. Their presence could represent an obstacle that impedes transcystic exploration. It has been suggested that the distribution of Heister valves follows a steady rhythmic pattern in a spiral disposition; however, there is no conclusive data to support this claim. The aim of this study was to describe the main characteristics of the CD and Heister valves in adult human cadavers. Methods A descriptive cross-sectional study was performed on 46 extrahepatic biliary tracts. Results The CD has an average length of 25.37 mm and diameter of 4.53 mm. The most frequent level of junction was themiddle union. Heister valves were present on 32 CDs; in most cases, they were distributed uniformly on the duct and presented an oblique disposition. A nonreticular pattern was the most frequent reticular pattern. The most frequent type of the nonreticular type was the B1 subtype. The most frequent type of distribution was the nonreticular type, particularly the B1 type. Conclusions The cystic fold could hinder transcystic exploration. The cysticotomy incision should not be determined by the distribution of the fold on the CD. The morphology of the Heister valves does not show evidence of a steady systematic pattern.

However, in Argentina no comprehensive research has been done on firearms use in femicides. This study explores the role of firearms in intimate violence in general and in femicide in particular in order to assess existing prevention measures. It proposes: a) to review the academic literature and the existing legislation on femicide in general, and in Latin America and in Argentina in particular; b) to highlight international concerns about the use of firearms in femicides; c) to analyze available statistics on intimate violence and femicide involving firearms use in Argentina and d) to reflect on legislative initiatives, policies and social actions to improve preventive measures to reduce the use of the most lethal tool to commit femicide: firearms.

However, these species can interact positively with local communities, increasing their richness, or the abundance of some species. Many invasive species are capable of influencing the habitat itself, by ameliorating physical stress and facilitating the colonization and survival of other organisms. Barnacles are common engineer species that can change the physical structure of the environment, its complexity, and heterogeneity through their own structure. Balanus glandula is a native barnacle of the rocky shores of the west coast of North America. In Argentina, this invasive species not only colonizes rocky shores but it also has successfully colonized soft-bottom salt marshes, where hard substrata are a limiting resource. In these environments, barnacles form three-dimensional structures that increase the structural complexity of the invaded salt marshes. In this work, we compared the composition, density, richness, and diversity of the macroinvertebrate assemblages associated with habitats of different structural complexity in two Patagonian salt marshes where B. glandula is well established. Our results showed differences in the relative distribution and abundances of the invertebrate species between habitats of different complexities. Furthermore, the response of the communities to the changes in the structural complexity generated by B. glandula was different in the two marshes studied. This highlights the fact that B. glandula facilitates other invertebrates and affect community structure, mainly where the settlement substrata (Spartina vs. mussels) are not functionally similar to the barnacle. Thus, our work shows that the rocky shore B. glandula is currently a critical structuring component of the native invertebrate community of soft-bottom environments where this species was introduced along the coast of southern South America.

Here, we studied trait-based responses in three grassland and three afforested streams in a mountain watershed of Crdoba, Argentina. We hypothesized that afforestation would reduce functional diversity through a simplification of periphyton architecture resulting from reduction in light availability, and that changes in hydrological periods would influence community responses. Algal samples were collected at each stream during two different hydrological periods (high flow and low flow), and physicochemical variables were recorded. Selected traits included strategies and morphological characters related to resource access and disturbance resistance (size, morphological guild, resource requirement, attachment mechanism and life-form). We calculated two indices of functional diversity: Rao's quadratic entropy (FD (Q) ) and functional variance. Most trait categories showed a significant effect of one or both factors; 26 % discriminated between vegetation types, 26 % reflect the changes between hydrological periods, and 47 % were sensitive to both of them. Our results revealed some categories of traits that can be used to distinguish changes in riparian vegetation, such as unicellular life-form and high-profile guild. Functional diversity of single traits was affected differently by pine afforestation. However, the most integrative index, the FD (Q) mean, partially supported our hypotheses. Afforestation reduced FD (Q) mean by 50 %, but only during low-flow period. FD (Q) mean was high and similar between streams at high flow, when environmental factors, such as discharge and temperature, could prevail on differences in riparian vegetation.

In some algae and cyanobacteria (as Anabaena), under low iron conditions, flavodoxin (Fld) replaces Fd as single electron carrier. Extensive mutational studies have characterized the protein-protein interaction in FNR/Fd and FNR/Fld complexes. Interestingly, even though Fd and Fld share the interaction site on FNR, individual residues on FNR do not participate to the same extent in the interaction with each of the protein partners, pointing to different electron transfer mechanisms. Despite of extensive mutational studies, only FNR/Fd X-ray structures from Anabaena and maize have been solved; structural data for FNR/Fld remains elusive. Here, we present a multiscale modelling approach including coarse-grained and all-atom protein-protein docking, the QM/MM e-Pathway analysis and electronic coupling calculations, allowing for a molecular and electronic comprehensive analysis of the ET process in both complexes. Our results, consistent with experimental mutational data, reveal the ET in FNR/Fd proceeding through a bridge-mediated mechanism in a dominant protein-protein complex, where transfer of the electron is facilitated by Fd loop-residues 40-49.

Results The phenolic compounds detected were, in general, comparable to data previously reported but hydroxycinnamic acids were detected at higher concentrations than determined in other studies. Addition of LMF at identical concentrations present in wine or a four times concentrated LMF mixture to a synthetic wine-like medium produced a diminution in bacterial viability and exopolysaccharide production in the supernatant culture. Transmission electron microscopy revealed damage of bacterial cell integrity after 96 h of incubation only in the presence of four times concentrated LMF. Conclusion This is the first time a low molecular weight phenolic fraction has been characterized in Cafayate wine and it has demonstrated a marked antimicrobial effect on an exopolysaccharide-producing wine spoilage bacterium.

The resonance overlap and Hill stability criteria revisited	CELESTIAL MECHANICS & DYNAMICAL ASTRONOMY			English	Article						Eccentric orbits; Mean-motion resonances; Resonance overlap criterion; Stability; Three-body problem	OSCILLATOR-SYSTEMS; SOLAR-SYSTEM; CHAOTIC ZONE; ECCENTRICITY; PLANETS; INSTABILITY; BEHAVIOR	We review the orbital stability of the planar circular restricted three-body problem in the case of massless particles initially located between both massive bodies. We present new estimates of the resonance overlap criterion and the Hill stability limit and compare their predictions with detailed dynamical maps constructed with N-body simulations. We show that the boundary between (Hill) stable and unstable orbits is not smooth but characterized by a rich structure generated by the superposition of different mean-motion resonances, which does not allow for a simple global expression for stability. We propose that, for a given perturbing mass and initial eccentricity e, there are actually two critical values of the semimajor axis. All values are Hill-stable, while all values are unstable in the Hill sense. The first limit is given by the Hill-stability criterion and is a function of the eccentricity. The second limit is virtually insensitive to the initial eccentricity and closely resembles a new resonance overlap condition (for circular orbits) developed in terms of the intersection between first- and second-order mean-motion resonances.

However, to our knowledge, no studies have compared the use of this test with intraoperative frozen section, which is considered by many to be the best intraoperative test now available. Questions/purposes We asked whether intraoperative SCRP could lead to comparable sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values as intraoperative frozen section in revision total hip arthroplasty. Methods A prospective study was performed including 76 patients who underwent hip revision for any cause. SCRP quantification (using 9.5 mg/L as denoting infection) and the analysis of frozen section of intraoperative samples (five or more polymorphonuclear leukocytes under high magnification in 10 fields) were performed in all the patients. The definitive diagnosis of an infection was determined according to the Musculoskeletal Infection Society (MSIS). In this group, 30% of the patients were diagnosed with infection using the MSIS criteria (23 of 76 patients). Results With the numbers available, there were no differences between SCRP and frozen section in terms of their ability to diagnose infection. The sensitivity of SCRP was 90% (95% confidence interval [CI], 70.8%-98.6%), the specificity was 94% (95% CI, 84.5%-98.7%), the positive predictive value was 87% (95% CI, 66.3%-97%), and the negative predictive value was 96% (95% CI, 87%-99.4%); the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were the same using frozen sections to diagnose infection. The positive likelihood ratio was 16.36 (95% CI, 5.4-49.5), indicating a low probability of an individual without the condition having a positive test, and the negative likelihood ratio was 0.10 (95% CI, 0.03-0.36), indicating low probability of an individual without the condition having a negative test. Conclusions We found that quantitative SCRP had similar diagnostic value as intraoperative frozen section with comparable sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value in a group of patients undergoing revision total hip arthroplasty. In our institution, SCRP is easier to obtain, less expensive, and less dependent on the technique of obtaining and interpreting a frozen section. If our findings are confirmed by other groups, we suggest that quantitative SCRP be considered as a viable alternative to frozen section.

Analysis of lipid and fatty acid composition of three species of scorpions with relation to different organs	COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY B-BIOCHEMISTRY & MOLECULAR BIOLOGY			English	Article						Fatty acid; Lipids; Phospholipids; Scorpion; Triacylglycerides	SHRIMP MACROBRACHIUM-BORELLII; POLYBETES-PYTHAGORICUS; EURYPELMA-CALIFORNICUM; MANDUCA-SEXTA; ARID CHACO; HEMOLYMPH; LIPOPROTEINS; HEPATOPANCREAS; METABOLISM; TRANSPORT	Within arthropods most of the information related to the type of mobilization and storage of lipids is found in insects and crustaceans. Literature is scarce with relation to scorpions. This order is a remarkably important model of the biochemistry, since it is characterized as an animal with very primitive traits which have varied minimally through time. In the present study we characterize and compare lipids and fatty acids present in three species of scorpion: Timogenes elegans, Timogenes dorbignyi, and Brachistostemus ferrugineus, focusing the study on the main organs/tissues involved in the dynamics of lipids. As found in the fat body of insects, hepatopancreas of crustaceans and midgut diverticula of spiders, the hepatopancreas of the three species studied here turned out to be the organ of lipid storage (great quantity of triacylglycerides). With relation to the hemolymph and muscles, a great quantity of phospholipids was observed, which is possibly involved in membrane formation. It is important to highlight that unlike what happens in insects, in scorpions the main circulating energetic lipid is the triacylglyceride. This lipid is found in greater proportion in the hepatopancreas of females, surely for reproduction. The fatty acid of the different organs/tissues analyzed remained constant in the three species studied with certain characteristic patterns, thus observing saturated and unsaturated most abundant fatty acids of C16 and C18. Finally, it could be observed that in T. elegans, T. dorbignyi and B. ferrugineus scorpions, there is a lack of 20:4 that generates a special condition within fatty acids of arthropods.

We used the Cantabrian capercaillie, a forest bird, as a model to assess the effects of the reduction in the number of breeding males (increased OSR) associated to male-biased hunting, on the genetics of the population. We based our assessment in the comparison of the dynamics of neutral markers transmitted by both parents (microsatellites) versus markers transmitted only by females (mitochondrial DNA-mtDNA). Parallel to the analysis of field data, we ran computer simulations to explore how different levels of OSR and two other important demographic factors, population size and connectivity, might influence the dynamics of genetic variation of microsatellites and mtDNA. We found evidence of a genetic bottleneck and low genetic variability affecting microsatellites but not mtDNA early in our study period, when male-biased hunting was more intense. This was followed by a decline in mtDNA variation around 10-20 years later. Simulations suggested that changes in genetic variation associated with high OSR had the closest similarity to those observed at the beginning of our study, whereas a combination of reduced size and migration rate better resembled the patterns found later on. Our findings indicate that male-biased hunting might have triggered the ongoing decline of the Cantabrian capercaillie, on its own or in combination with habitat configuration, and support the need to incorporate OSR into decision making for the management and conservation of exploited populations.

Biological processes used for decontamination of nitroaromatic-polluted sources have then attracted worldwide attention. In the present investigation m-nitrophenol (MNP) biodegradation was studied in batch and continuous reactors. A bacterial community able to degrade the compound was first selected from a polluted freshwater stream and the isolates were identified by the analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence. The bacterial community was then used in biodegradation assays. Batch experiments were conducted in a 2 L aerobic microfermentor at 28 degrees C and with agitation (200 rpm). The influence of abiotic factors in the biodegradation process in batch reactors, such as initial concentration of the compound and initial pH of the medium, was also studied. Continuous degradation of MNP was performed in an aerobic up-flow fixed-bed biofilm reactor. The biodegradation process was evaluated by determining MNP and ammonium concentrations and chemical oxygen demand (COD). Detoxification was assessed by Vibrio fischeri and Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata toxicity tests. Under batch conditions the bacterial community was able to degrade 0.72 mM of MNP in 32 h, with efficiencies higher than 99.9% and 89.0% of MNP and COD removals respectively and with concomitant release of ammonium. When the initial MNP concentration increased to 1.08 and 1.44 mM MNP the biodegradation process was accomplished in 40 and 44 h, respectively. No biodegradation of the compound was observed at higher concentrations. The community was also able to degrade 0.72 mM of the compound at pH 5, 7 and 9. In the continuous process biodegradation efficiency reached 99.5% and 96.8% of MNP and COD removal respectively. The maximum MNP removal rate was 37.9 g m(-3) day(-1). Toxicity was not detected after the biodegradation process. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The exploration of more than a thousand of constitutional, topological, geometrical and electronic molecular descriptors, which are calculated with Dragon software, leads to predictions of the growth inhibition on Pythium sp and Corticium rolfsii fungi species, in close agreement to the experimental values extracted from the literature. A set containing 21 new structurally related cinnamate compounds is prepared. The developed QSAR models are applied to predict the unknown fungicidal activity of this set, showing that cinnamates like 38,28 and 42 are expected to be highly active for Pythium sp, while this is also predicted for 28 and 34 in C. rolfsii.

Changes in toxicity on Rhinella arenarum larvae for 10-d were monitored after exposure to an untreated Cr(VI) solution and to the same solution after HP treatment. The HP treatment of a 41.60 mg L-1 Cr(VI) solution reduced to 37.5% the concentration of the metal ion. A 10-fold reduction in toxicity at acute exposure (72 h) and 150-fold reduction in toxicity after 240 h was found. Further, the LOEC value increased from 0.001% for the untreated solution to 0.153% after HP treatment. Moreover, the safe concentration in untreated solution corresponded to 0.0001% sample, and it was 0.01% after the treatment, i.e., 100 times higher. A saving of water of about 100,000 L per L of effluent would be possible through dilution to allow safer concentrations for discharge; the saving would reach the highest value (1,000,000 L per L) at 240 h.

However, the continued use of food-based feedstock such as maize is widely seen as unsustainable and is in some cases linked to deforestation and increased greenhouse gas emissions, raising further doubts about long-term sustainability. As a result, many nations are exploring the production and use of cellulosic feedstock, though progress has been extremely slow. In this paper, we will review the North-South axis of biofuel production in the Pan American region and its linkage with the agricultural sectors in five countries. Focus will be given to biofuel policy goals, their results to date, and consideration of sustainability criteria and certification of producers. Policy goals, results, and sustainability will be highlighted for the main biofuel policies that have been enacted at the national level. Geographic focus will be given to the two largest producers-the United States and Brazil; two smaller emerging producers-Argentina and Canada; and one stalled program-Mexico. However, several additional countries in the region are either producing or planning to produce biofuels. We will also review alternative international governance schemes for biofuel sustainability that have been recently developed, and whether the biofuel programs are being managed to achieve improved environmental quality and sustainable development.

As such, the water footprints of bioenergy sources vary significantly by type of feedstock, soil characteristics, cultivation practices, and hydro-climatic regime. Furthermore, water management implications of bioenergy production depend on existing land use, relative water availability, and competing water uses at a watershed scale. This paper reviews previous research on the water resource impacts of bioenergy production-from plot-scale hydrologic and nutrient cycling impacts to watershed and regional scale hydro-economic systems relationships. Primary gaps in knowledge that hinder policy development for integrated management of water-bioenergy systems are highlighted. Four case studies in the Americas are analyzed to illustrate relevant spatial and temporal scales for impact assessment, along with unique aspects of biofuel production compared to other agroforestry systems, such as energy-related conflicts and tradeoffs. Based on the case studies, the potential benefits of integrated resource management are assessed, as is the need for further case-specific research.

Biogeochemical Research Priorities for Sustainable Biofuel and Bioenergy Feedstock Production in the Americas	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Agroecosystem; Bioenergy feedstock; Carbon; Forestry; Soil; Sustainability	SOIL ORGANIC-CARBON; GREENHOUSE-GAS EMISSIONS; LONG-TERM EXPERIMENTS; CORN STOVER REMOVAL; LOBLOLLY-PINE PLANTATIONS; LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; PROCESS-BASED MODEL; MIXED OAK FOREST; LAND-USE CHANGE; ZEA-MAYS L.	Rapid expansion in biomass production for biofuels and bioenergy in the Americas is increasing demand on the ecosystem resources required to sustain soil and site productivity. We review the current state of knowledge and highlight gaps in research on biogeochemical processes and ecosystem sustainability related to biomass production. Biomass production systems incrementally remove greater quantities of organic matter, which in turn affects soil organic matter and associated carbon and nutrient storage (and hence long-term soil productivity) and off-site impacts. While these consequences have been extensively studied for some crops and sites, the ongoing and impending impacts of biomass removal require management strategies for ensuring that soil properties and functions are sustained for all combinations of crops, soils, sites, climates, and management systems, and that impacts of biomass management (including off-site impacts) are environmentally acceptable. In a changing global environment, knowledge of cumulative impacts will also become increasingly important. Long-term experiments are essential for key crops, soils, and management systems because short-term results do not necessarily reflect long-term impacts, although improved modeling capability may help to predict these impacts. Identification and validation of soil sustainability indicators for both site prescriptions and spatial applications would better inform commercial and policy decisions. In an increasingly inter-related but constrained global context, researchers should engage across inter-disciplinary, inter-agency, and international lines to better ensure the long-term soil productivity across a range of scales, from site to landscape.

A Review of Environmental Life Cycle Assessments of Liquid Transportation Biofuels in the Pan American Region	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Life-cycle assessment; Biofuels; Bioenergy; Sustainability; Pan American region	GREENHOUSE-GAS EMISSIONS; LAND-USE CHANGE; ENERGY-BALANCE; UNITED-STATES; CORN-ETHANOL; BIOENERGY; BIODIESEL; BRAZIL; FUEL; CONSUMPTION	Life-cycle assessment (LCA) has been applied to many biofuel and bioenergy systems to determine potential environmental impacts, but the conclusions have varied. Different methodologies and processes for conducting LCA of biofuels make the results difficult to compare, in-turn making it difficult to make the best possible and informed decision. Of particular importance are the wide variability in country-specific conditions, modeling assumptions, data quality, chosen impact categories and indicators, scale of production, system boundaries, and co-product allocation. This study has a double purpose: conducting a critical evaluation comparing environmental LCA of biofuels from several conversion pathways and in several countries in the Pan American region using both qualitative and quantitative analyses, and making recommendations for harmonization with respect to biofuel LCA study features, such as study assumptions, inventory data, impact indicators, and reporting practices. The environmental management implications are discussed within the context of different national and international regulatory environments using a case study. The results from this study highlight LCA methodology choices that cause high variability in results and limit comparability among different studies, even among the same biofuel pathway, and recommendations are provided for improvement.

Most productions rely on complex transforming chains linked to feed and food markets. The term 'supply chain' covers various aspects from cultivation and harvesting of the biomass, to treatment, transportation, and storage. After energy conversion, the product must be delivered to final consumption, whether it is in the form of electricity, heat, or more tangible products, such as pellets and biofuels. Effective supply chains are of utmost importance for bioenergy production, as biomass tends to possess challenging seasonal production cycles and low mass, energy and bulk densities. Additionally, the demand for final products is often also dispersed, further complicating the supply chain. The goal of this paper is to introduce key components of biomass supply chains, examples of related modeling applications, and if/how they address aspects related to environmental metrics and management. The paper will introduce a concept of integrated supply systems for sustainable biomass trade and the factors influencing the bioenergy supply chain landscape, including models that can be used to investigate the factors. The paper will also cover various aspects of transportation logistics, ranging from alternative modal and multi-modal alternatives to introduction of support tools for transportation analysis. Finally gaps and challenges in supply chain research are identified and used to outline research recommendations for the future direction in this area of study.

The associations between GHRd3 and growth response to r-hGH over 3 years in relation to severity of GH deficiency (GHD) were investigated in patients from 14 countries. Treatment-naive pre-pubertal children with GHD were enrolled from the PREDICT studies (NCT00256126 and NCT00699855), categorized by peak GH level (peak GH) during provocation test: % 4 mg/l (severe GHD; n=45) and >4 to <10 mu g/l mild GHD; n=49) and genotyped for the GHRd3 polymorphism (full length (fl/fl, fl/d3, d3/d3). Gene expression (GE) profiles were characterized at baseline. Changes in growth (height (cm) and SDS) over 3 years were measured. There was a dichotomous influence of GHRd3 polymorphism on response to r-hGH, dependent on peak GH level. GH peak level (higher vs lower) and GHRd3 (fl/fl vs d3 carriers) combined status was associated with height change over 3 years (P<0.05). GHRd3 carriers with lower peak GH had lower growth than subjects with fl/fl (median difference after 3 years -3.3 cm; -0.3 SDS). Conversely, GHRd3 carriers with higher peak GH had better growth (+2.7 cm; +0.2 SDS). Similar patterns were observed for GH-dependent biomarkers. GE profiles were significantly different between the groups, indicating that the interaction between GH status and GHRd3 carriage can be identified at a transcriptomic level. This study demonstrates that responses to r-hGH depend on the interaction between GHD severity and GHRd3 carriage.

Conservation biological control in strawberry: effect of different pollen on development, survival, and reproduction of Neoseiulus californicus (Acari: Phytoseiidae)	EXPERIMENTAL AND APPLIED ACAROLOGY			English	Article						Neoseiulus californicus; Conservation; Wild vegetation; Pollen; Strawberry	TETRANYCHUS-URTICAE ACARI; SPIDER-MITE; MANAGEMENT; PREDATORS; PERSIMILIS; VINEYARDS; ABUNDANCE; PLANTS	Wild vegetation surrounding crops may provide temporary habitat and potential food sources for phytoseiids in different seasons. Monthly vegetation samples of wild plants adjacent to strawberry plants and wild plants in a vegetation strip close to the crop were taken. The frequency of Neoseiulus californicus, Tetranychus urticae and other mites and insects was recorded. In addition, in a laboratory assay, the survival, developmental time and fecundity of females fed on pollen of strawberry and pollen of wild plants where N. californicus was recorded during their flowering, were estimated. Pollen from Urtica urens, Lamium amplexicaule, Convolvulus arvensis, Sonchus oleraceous, Galega officinalis, and Fragaria x ananassa (strawberry) allowed development of N. californicus to adult, but not reproduction. Survival was 70-80 % when fed on pollen from S. oleraceus, G. officinalis and C. arvensis, 80-90 % when fed on pollen from U. urens and F. x ananassa, and more than 90 % when fed on T. urticae and on pollen from L. amplexicaule. In autumn and winter, U. urens, L. amplexicaule and S. oleraceous could promote the persistence of N. californicus when prey density in strawberry is low, offering T. urticae, thrips and pollen. In summer, pollen of C. arvensis and G. officinalis would contribute to the persistence of N. californicus when the strawberry crop is ending and offers scarce food resources. Although the pollen of these plants would not enable the predator population to increase, the presence of these plants in the vicinity of strawberry could contribute to the persistence of N. californicus population and help to limit T. urticae growth when this pest begins to colonize the crop.

At pH 7 HIUS without heating decreased the particle size. In contrast, the use of thermosonication (TS) increased the particle size. At pH 3, the application of both HIUS and TS induced a significant reduction of particle size. at pH 7 zeta potential did not vary significantly when native solutions were sonicated without heating; however a great decrease was observed when TS or heating were applied. At pH 3, sonication decreased the zeta potential of particles but TS or heating increased the charge. By applying TS (85 A degrees C, 20 min and pH 3) a bimodal distribution was obtained, including particles of 295 and 70 nm of diameter. At the same pH, without heating, a monomodal population of 220 nm of diameter was obtained.	[Arzeni, Carolina; Perez, Oscar E.; Pilosof, Ana M.

J	Haber, A				Haber, Alejandro			Contratiempo: Contract Archaeology or a Trench in the Battle for the Dead	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HISTORICAL ARCHAEOLOGY			English	Article						Epistemic assumptions; Epistemology of archaeology; Discipline; Post-discipline		Why is it that, in the present context of territorial intervention of capital, contract archaeology (CA) is so efficient in terms of the market? In order to approach an answer to this question, the deep complicities between, on the one side, the theoretical-methodological assumptions technologically reconverted by CA and, on the other, the hegemonic ontological and epistemic assumptions mobilized by the narratives of development are anatomized. After featuring the fundamentals of the specific post-disciplinary form of CA, its totalitarian vocation implied in its opposition to the unheard dissident voices is exposed. In the context of the border, CA can be either seen as an efficient professional expansion (from the hegemonic viewpoint) or as a trench in the battle for the dead.

In particular, models based on an elementary local interaction V(x) are discussed as motivated by the naturally emergent possibility of an efficient regularization of an otherwise unacceptable presence of a strongly singular repulsive core in the origin. The emphasis is put on the constructive aspects of the models. Besides the overall outline of the formalism we show how the low-lying energies of bound states may be found in closed form in certain dynamical regimes. Finally, once these energies are found real we explain that in spite of a manifest non-Hermiticity of the Hamiltonian the time-evolution of the system becomes unitary in a properly amended physical Hilbert space.

Transformation dynamics of the natural cover in the Dry Chaco ecoregion: A plot level geo-database from 1976 to 2012	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS			English	Article						Deforestation; Geo-database; Monitoring; Land use change; Annual rate of forest change	TEMPERATE SOUTH-AMERICA; HABITAT FRAGMENTATION; BRAZILIAN AMAZON; LAND-COVER; DEFORESTATION; ARGENTINA; FOREST; AGRICULTURE; WORLDS; CONSEQUENCES	The aim of this work was to characterize the spatial and temporal dynamics of the transformation of the natural cover in the Dry Chaco ecoregion from 1976 to 2012. Dry forests in this region have one of the highest deforestation rates in the world. We analyzed 44 Landsat scenes, including part of Argentina, Paraguay and Bolivia. The analysis was based on tracking individual transformed plots of the entire Dry Chaco region for over more than three decades using the same protocol. Until the end of 2012 15.8 million ha of the original habitats of the Chaco were transformed into croplands or pastures. Our study showed that the greater annual rates of transformation were observed in Paraguay, where deforestation increased dramatically in the last decade, reaching values higher than 4.0% in 2010, the highest historical value in the entire region. The size of the transformed plots increased significantly through the studied period both in Argentina and Paraguay, while in Bolivia decreased. At the landscape level, the use of several fragmentation indices showed the disruption of the continuity and connectivity of the original vegetation. The spatially explicit description of the dynamics of transformed areas is an indispensable tool for natural resources management, territorial planning and deforestation impacts assessment.

J	Volante, JN; Paruelo, JM				Volante, Jose N.; Paruelo, Jose M.			Is forest or Ecological Transition taking place? Evidence for the Semiarid Chaco in Argentina	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS			English	Article						Forest Transition; Land-sparing; Deforestation; Dry Chaco; Remote-sensing	LANDSAT IMAGERY; NW ARGENTINA; TASSELED CAP; DRY FORESTS; DEFORESTATION; DISTURBANCE; DYNAMICS; GLOBALIZATION; AGRICULTURE; TRANSFORMATION	The expression Forest Transition (FT) and Ecological Transition (ET) were coined to describe the recovery path of forested areas (or more general natural vegetation) after heavy conversion into croplands. FT/ET would be driven by two main socio-economic controls: a) agricultural intensification in the most productive areas and the simultaneous reduction of cropped area in the less suitable areas (land-sparing); and b) rural population migration from rural to urban areas. In the argentine portion of the Semiarid Chaco a rapid and extensive clearing for industrial agriculture and cattle ranching based on sown pastures is taking place. In this article we evaluated the occurrence, magnitude and localization of FT/ET in the argentine portion of the Semiarid Chaco during the 1977-2007 period using an approach based on remotely sensed data. From land cover maps we derived three diagnosis variables of FT/ET: (1) the area of natural vegetation at the end of the study period; (2) the rate of annual clearance (natural vegetation loss) for the whole period; and (3) the temporal change of the area of natural vegetation in the last portion of the study period. The diagnosis variables were combined to derive 12 classes (landscape types). We observed a systematic loss of the surface occupied by natural vegetation. Industrial agriculture grew in aggregated patches generating a homogenization of the landscape. In only a 4.8% of the study area we observed a pattern of change compatible with a FT/ET. In contrast, in a 34% of the study region (9.57 million ha) a clear negative trend in the cover of natural vegetation was observed during 1977-2007 period. The area that had a negative trend in the cover of natural vegetation was 7 times greater than the portion of the region experiencing positive trends. Such number indicates an imbalance in the landscape dynamics that would further reduce areas covered by natural vegetation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Gasparri, NI; Grau, HR; Sacchi, LV				Ignacio Gasparri, Nestor; Ricardo Grau, H.; Valeria Sacchi, Laura			Determinants of the spatial distribution of cultivated land in the North Argentine Dry Chaco in a multi-decadal study	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS			English	Article						Deforestation; Logistic regression; Agribusiness; Spatial model; Soybean	MECHANIZED AGRICULTURE; PROXIMATE CAUSES; DEFORESTATION; COVER; EXPANSION; FORESTS; DYNAMICS; AMERICA; ROADS; MODEL	Deforestation in the Northern Argentine Dry Chaco (NADC) has been mainly driven by soybean expansion and, more recently, by the expansion of implanted pastures. In areas with fast land use transformations, it is important to identify variables that determine the spatial distribution of land use change. The kinds of exploratory analyses that do so contribute to understanding the logic of deforestation agents and to identifying more probable sectors for land use change. We produced maps of cultivated land in NADC for different years (1972, 1991, 1997, 2002, 2007). Based on these maps, we evaluated the importance of environmental and accessibility variables over the spatial distribution of cultivated land in NADC using multiple and simple logistic regressions. Environmental variables (soil suitability for agriculture, rainfall, topography) and accessibility variables (distance to main roads, distance to main towns) were used to fit logistic regressions to the occurrence of cultivated land at different years as dependent variable. Goodness-of-fit was evaluated by the Relative Operating Characteristic (ROC) and Pseudo R2 indices. Results indicate that the main variables explaining the spatial distribution of cultivated land in 2007 are distance to main towns (ROC = 0.76; Pseudo R2 0.12) and soil suitability (ROC = 0.72; Pseudo R2 0.11). The capacity of environmental and accessibility variables to explain the spatial distribution of cultivated land decreased through time (ROC in 1972 = 0.91 and ROC in 2007 = 0.77). Results also suggest that rainfall has not been a major restriction to cropland expansion, and that the main limitations are imposed by infrastructure and services provided from main towns. A decreasing goodness-Of-fit over time suggests that initial limitations have been overcome by cropland expansion and the consolidation of productive areas. Based on these results, we suggest that cropland expansion may generate positive feedbacks in infrastructure and services (i.e. agglomeration economies) that could explain why initial limiting factors related with distance to roads and towns have been gradually overcome.

However, neotropical dry forest and savanna ecoregions include open habitats that may deserve conservation attention. We analyzed the historical patterns and potential distribution of natural grasslands, as well as their biodiversity in the northern Argentina dry Chaco, which is one of the largest and yet most rapidly transforming neotropical ecoregions. Paleocological literature, historical records, and bioclimatic modeling support the hypothesis that Chaco grasslands distribution was more extended in the past, and has been historically reduced by woody encroachment resulting from environmental changes occurred in the past century. Recent research shows that natural grasslands host distinctive components of the Chaco biodiversity, and a significant proportion of the vertebrate species have a negative association with woody biomass. Ongoing land use trends continue to threaten native grasslands both in unprotected sectors (where they are converted into agriculture and planted pastures) and inside protected areas (were fire suppression is favoring woody encroachment). Current conservation policies (Protected Areas, Argentine forest law, REDD+) neglect the importance of native grasslands for biodiversity conservation. Such forest-centered initiatives should be revised to specifically include native grasslands and their biodiversity into land use strategies that adequately balance agriculture and livestock production with biodiversity conservation.
